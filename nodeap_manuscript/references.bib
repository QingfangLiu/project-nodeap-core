   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Orbitofrontal cortex regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) is lower in cocaine-dependent subjects than in non-cocaine-dependent subjects. Performance on the Gambling Task, a test of decision making, is a putative correlate of orbitofrontal cortex activity and is reportedly impaired in drug-dependent subjects. The authors tested the hypothesis that lower Gambling Task scores would be associated with lower resting orbitofrontal cortex rCBF in cocaine-dependent subjects. METHOD: Fifteen healthy comparison subjects and 13 abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects underwent resting single photon emission computed tomography to measure rCBF, after which they completed the Gambling Task. RESULTS: Resting anterior cingulate and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rCBF significantly correlated with performance on the Gambling Task, but orbitofrontal cortex rCBF did not. Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rCBF was lower in the cocaine-dependent subjects than in the comparison subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Resting anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rCBF is significantly related to decision making, as assessed by the Gambling Task.},

   pages = {e0186007},
   abstract = {Transcranial magnetic studies typically rely on measures of active and resting motor threshold (i.e. AMT, RMT). Previous work has demonstrated that adaptive threshold hunting approaches are efficient for estimating RMT. To date, no study has compared motor threshold estimation approaches for measures of AMT, yet this measure is fundamental in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies that probe intracortical circuits. The present study compared two methods for acquiring AMT and RMT: the Rossini-Rothwell (R-R) relative-frequency estimation method and an adaptive threshold-hunting method based on maximum-likelihood parameter estimation by sequential testing (ML-PEST). AMT and RMT were quantified via the R-R and ML-PEST methods in 15 healthy right-handed participants in an experimenter-blinded within-subject study design. AMT and RMT estimations obtained with both the R-R and ML-PEST approaches were not different, with strong intraclass correlation and good limits of agreement. However, ML-PEST required 17 and 15 fewer stimuli than the R-R method for the AMT and RMT estimation, respectively. MLPEST is effective in reducing the number of TMS pulses required to estimate AMT and RMT without compromising the accuracy of these estimates. Using ML-PEST to estimate AMT and RMT increases the efficiency of the TMS experiment as it reduces the number of pulses to acquire these measures without compromising accuracy. The benefits of using the ML-PEST approach are amplified when multiple target muscles are tested within a session.},

In particular, we focus on models attempting to account for the empirical results of Marcus et al. (Science, 283(5398), 77–80 1999). In that study, evidence is reported of generalization behavior by 7-month-old infants, using an Artificial Language Learning paradigm. The authors fail to replicate this behavior in neural network simulations, and claim that this failure reveals inherent limitations of a whole class of neural networks: those that do not incorporate symbolic operations. A great number of computational models were proposed in follow-up studies, fuelling a heated debate about what is required for a model to generalize. Twenty years later, this debate is still not settled. In this paper, we review a large number of the proposed models. We present a critical analysis of those models, in terms of how they contribute to answer the most relevant questions raised by the experiment. After identifying which aspects require further research, we propose a list of desiderata for advancing our understanding on generalization.},

   abstract = {All moving objects generate sequential retinotopic activations representing a series of discrete locations in space and time (motion trajectory). How direction-selective neurons in mammalian early visual cortices process motion trajectory remains to be clarified. Using single-cell recording and optical imaging of intrinsic signals along with mathematical simulation, we studied response properties of cat visual areas 17 and 18 to random dots moving at various speeds. We found that, the motion trajectory at low speed was encoded primarily as a direction signal by groups of neurons preferring that motion direction. Above certain transition speeds, the motion trajectory is perceived as a spatial orientation representing the motion axis of the moving dots. In both areas studied, above these speeds, other groups of direction-selective neurons with perpendicular direction preferences were activated to encode the motion trajectory as motion-axis information. This applied to both simple and complex neurons. The average transition speed for switching between encoding motion direction and axis was about 31u/s in area 18 and 15u/s in area 17. A spatio-temporal energy model predicted the transition speeds accurately in both areas, but not the direction-selective indexes to random-dot stimuli in area 18. In addition, above transition speeds, the change of direction preferences of population responses recorded by optical imaging can be revealed using vector maximum but not vector summation method. Together, this combined processing of motion direction and axis by neurons with orthogonal direction preferences associated with speed may serve as a common principle of early visual motion processing.},

   abstract = {This article investigates the potential of fMRI to test assumptions about different components in models of complex cognitive tasks. If the components of a model can be associated with speciﬁc brain regions, one can make predictions for the temporal course of the BOLD response in these regions. An event-locked procedure is described for dealing with temporal variability and bringing model runs and individual data trials into alignment. Statistical methods for testing the model are described that deal with the scan-to-scan correlations in the errors of measurement of the BOLD signal. This approach is illustrated using a “sacriﬁcial” ACT-R model that involves mapping 6 modules onto 6 brain regions in an experiment from Ravizza, Anderson, and Carter (in press) concerned with equation solving. The model’s visual encoding predicted the BOLD response in the fusiform gyrus, its controlled retrieval predicted the BOLD response in the lateral inferior prefrontal cortex, and its subgoal setting predicted the BOLD response in the anterior cingulate cortex. On the other hand, its motor programming failed to predict anticipatory activation in the motor cortex, its representational changes failed to predicted the pattern of activity in the posterior parietal cortex, and its procedural component failed to predict an initial spike in caudate. The results illustrate the power of such data to direct the development of a theory of complex problem solving, both at the level of a speciﬁc task model as well as at the level of the cognitive architecture.},

To understand its neural basis, we simultaneously recorded from multiple electrodes in lateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum, two interconnected brain structures critical for learning. Each day, monkeys learned to associate novel abstract, dot-based categories with a right versus left saccade. Early on, when they could acquire specific stimulus-response associations, striatum activity was an earlier predictor of the corresponding saccade. However, as the number of exemplars increased and monkeys had to learn to classify them, PFC activity began to predict the saccade associated with each category before the striatum. While monkeys were categorizing novel exemplars at a high rate, PFC activity was a strong predictor of their corresponding saccade early in the trial before the striatal neurons. These results suggest that striatum plays a greater role in stimulus-response association and PFC in abstraction of categories.},

We recorded from multiple electrodes in PFC and STR while monkeys acquired new categories. Category learning was accompanied by an increase in beta band synchronization of LFPs between, but not within, the PFC and STR. After learning, different pairs of PFC-STR electrodes showed stronger synchrony for one or the other category, suggesting category-specific functional circuits. This category-specific synchrony was also seen between PFC spikes and STR LFPs, but not the reverse, reflecting the direct monosynaptic connections from the PFC to STR. However, causal connectivity analyses suggested that the polysynaptic connections from STR to the PFC exerted a stronger overall influence. This supports models positing that the basal ganglia "train" the PFC. Category learning may depend on the formation of functional circuits between the PFC and STR.},

   abstract = {The prefrontal (PF) cortex has been implicated in the remarkable ability of primates to form and rearrange arbitrary associations rapidly. This ability was studied in two monkeys, using a task that required them to learn to make specific saccades in response to particular cues and then repeatedly reverse these responses. We found that the activity of individual PF neurons represented both the cues and the associated responses, perhaps providing a neural substrate for their association. Furthermore, during learning, neural activity conveyed the direction of the animals’ impending responses progressively earlier within each successive trial. The final level of activity just before the response, however, was unaffected by learning. These results suggest a role for the PF cortex in learning arbitrary cue–response associations, an ability critical for complex behavior.},

   abstract = {A biologically detailed computational model is described of how categorization judgments become automatic in tasks that depend on procedural learning. The model assumes 2 neural pathways from sensory association cortex to the premotor area that mediates response selection. A longer and slower path projects to the premotor area via the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus. A faster, purely cortical path projects directly to the premotor area. The model assumes that the subcortical path has greater neural plasticity because of a dopamine-mediated learning signal from the substantia nigra. In contrast, the cortical-cortical path learns more slowly via (dopamine independent) Hebbian learning. Because of its greater plasticity, early performance is dominated by the subcortical path, but the development of automaticity is characterized by a transfer of control to the faster cortical-cortical projection. The model, called SPEED (Subcortical Pathways Enable Expertise Development), includes differential equations that describe activation in the relevant brain areas and difference equations that describe the 2- and 3-factor learning. A variety of simulations are described, showing that the model accounts for some classic single-cell recording and behavioral results.},

   journal = {Memory & Cognition},
   abstract = {In rule-based (RB) category-learning tasks, the optimal strategy is a simple explicit rule, whereas in information-integration (II) tasks, the optimal strategy is impossible to describe verbally. Many studies have reported qualitative dissociations between training and performance in RB and II tasks. Virtually all of these studies were testing predictions of the dual-systems model of category learning called COVIS. The most prominent alternative account to COVIS is that humans have one learning system that is used in all tasks, and that the observed dissociations occur because the II task is more difficult than the RB task. This article describes the first attempt to test this difficulty hypothesis against anything more than a single set of data. First, two novel predictions are derived that discriminate between the difficulty and multiple-systems hypotheses. Next, these predictions are tested against a wide variety of published categorization data. Overall, the results overwhelmingly reject the difficulty hypothesis and instead strongly favor the multiple-systems account of the many RB versus II dissociations.},

   abstract = {Multidimensional signal detection theory is a multivariate extension of signal detection theory that makes two fundamental assumptions, namely that every mental state is noisy and that every action requires a decision. The most widely studied version is known as general recognition theory (GRT). General recognition theory assumes that the percept on each trial can be modeled as a random sample from a multivariate probability distribution defined over the perceptual space. Decision bounds divide this space into regions that are each associated with a response alternative. General recognition theory rigorously defines and tests a number of important perceptual and cognitive conditions, including perceptual and decisional separability and perceptual independence. General recognition theory has been used to analyze data from identification experiments in two ways: (1) fitting and comparing models that make different assumptions about perceptual and decisional processing, and (2) testing assumptions by computing summary statistics and checking whether these satisfy certain conditions. Much has been learned recently about the neural networks that mediate the perceptual and decisional processing modeled by GRT, and this knowledge can be used to improve the design of experiments where a GRT analysis is anticipated.},

A subsequent test that required participants to categorize new faces from each family showed successful generalization in both experiments. Furthermore, perceived similarity ratings for pairs of faces were collected before and after learning, prior to generalization test. In Experiment 1, similarity ratings increased for faces within a family and decreased for faces that were physically similar but belonged to different families. In Experiment 2, overall similarity ratings decreased after learning, driven primarily by decreases for physically similar faces from different families. The post-learning category bias in similarity ratings was predictive of subsequent generalization success in both experiments. The results indicate that individuals formed generalizable category knowledge prior to an explicit demand to generalize and did so both when attention was directed towards category-relevant features (Experiment 1) and when attention was directed towards individuating faces within a family (Experiment 2). The results tie together research on category learning and categorical perception and extend them beyond a traditional category-learning task.},

   abstract = {A recently introduced Bayesian model for magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data consistently localized multiple simulated dipoles with the help of marginalization of spatiotemporal background noise covariance structure in the analysis [Jun et al., (2005): Neuroimage 28:84–98]. Here, we elaborated this model to include subject’s individual brain surface reconstructions with cortical location and orientation constraints. To enable efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of the dipole locations, we adopted a parametrization of the source space surfaces with two continuous variables (i.e., spherical angle coordinates). Prior to analysis, we simpliﬁed the likelihood by exploiting only a small set of independent measurement combinations obtained by singular value decomposition of the gain matrix, which also makes the sampler signiﬁcantly faster. We analyzed both realistically simulated and empirical MEG data recorded during simple auditory and visual stimulation. The results show that our model produces reasonable solutions and adequate data ﬁts without much manual interaction. However, the rigid cortical constraints seemed to make the utilized scheme challenging as the sampler did not switch modes of the dipoles efﬁciently. This is problematic in the presence of evidently highly multimodal posterior distribution, and especially in the relative quantitative comparison of the different modes. To overcome the difﬁculties with the present model, we propose the use of loose orientation constraints and combined model of prelocalization utilizing the hierarchical minimum-norm estimate and multiple dipole sampling scheme.

   abstract = {With globalization and immigration, societal contexts differ in sheer variety of resident social groups. Social diversity challenges individuals to think in new ways about new kinds of people and where their groups all stand, relative to each other. However, psychological science does not yet specify how human minds represent social diversity, in homogeneous or heterogenous contexts. Mental maps of the array of society’s groups should differ when individuals inhabit more and less diverse ecologies. Nonetheless, predictions disagree on how they should differ. Confirmation bias suggests more diversity means more stereotype dispersion: With increased exposure, perceivers’ mental maps might differentiate more among groups, so their stereotypes would spread out (disperse). In contrast, individuation suggests more diversity means less stereotype dispersion, as perceivers experience within-group variety and between-group overlap. Worldwide, nationwide, individual, and longitudinal datasets ( n = 12,011) revealed a diversity paradox: More diversity consistently meant less stereotype dispersion. Both contextual and perceived ethnic diversity correlate with decreased stereotype dispersion. Countries and US states with higher levels of ethnic diversity (e.g., South Africa and Hawaii, versus South Korea and Vermont), online individuals who perceive more ethnic diversity, and students who moved to more ethnically diverse colleges mentally represent ethnic groups as more similar to each other, on warmth and competence stereotypes. Homogeneity shows more-differentiated stereotypes; ironically, those with the least exposure have the most-distinct stereotypes. Diversity means less-differentiated stereotypes, as in the melting pot metaphor. Diversity and reduced dispersion also correlate positively with subjective wellbeing.},

   abstract = {During realistic, continuous perception, humans automatically segment experiences into discrete events. Using a novel model of cortical event dynamics, we investigate how cortical structures generate event representations during narrative perception and how these events are stored to and retrieved from memory. Our data-driven approach allows us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain activity without relying on stimulus annotations and reveals a nested hierarchy from short events in sensory regions to long events in highorder areas (including angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex), which represent abstract, multimodal situation models. High-order event boundaries are coupled to increases in hippocampal activity, which predict pattern reinstatement during later free recall. These areas also show evidence of anticipatory reinstatement as subjects listen to a familiar narrative. Based on these results, we propose that brain activity is naturally structured into nested events, which form the basis of long-term memory representations.},

Importantly, odor concentration rises with physical proximity to an odorous source, suggesting a framework for orienting within olfactory landscapes to optimize behavior. Here, we created a two-dimensional odor space composed purely of odor stimuli to model how a navigator encounters smells in a natural environment. We show that human subjects can learn to navigate in olfactory space and form predictions of to-be-encountered smells. During navigation, fMRI responses in entorhinal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex take the form of grid-like representations with hexagonal periodicity and entorhinal grid strength scaled with behavioral performance across subjects. The identiﬁcation of olfactory grid-like codes with 6-fold symmetry highlights a unique neural mechanism by which odor information can be assembled into spatially navigable cognitive maps, optimizing orientation, and path ﬁnding toward an odor source.},

The optimal strategy in these tasks is to choose the first option that is above a threshold that depends on the current position in the sequence. The implicit decision-making strategies by humans vary but largely diverge from this optimal strategy. The reasons for this divergence remain unknown. We present a model of human stopping decisions in sequential decision-making tasks based on a linear threshold heuristic. The first two studies demonstrate that the linear threshold model accounts better for sequential decision making than existing models. Moreover, we show that the model accurately predicts participants’ search behavior in different environments. In the third study, we confirm that the model generalizes to a real-world problem, thus providing an important step toward understanding human sequential decision making.},

This highly dynamic mapping system enables rapid reorganization of codes through remapping between orthogonal representations across behavioral contexts, yielding a multitude of stable cognitive spaces at different resolutions and hierarchical levels. Action sequences result in trajectories through cognitive space, which can be simulated via sequential coding in the hippocampus. In this way, the spatial representational format of the hippocampal formation has the capacity to support flexible cognition and behavior.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has broadly disrupted biomedical treatment and research including non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. Objective: To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). Methods: The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reﬂects the analysis of experts with domain-relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research e with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for speciﬁc demographics. Results: A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, speciﬁc considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations speciﬁcally for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. Conclusion: There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind. The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientiﬁc rigor and managing risk.},

   abstract = {Pain is processed in multiple brain areas, indicating the complexity of pain perception. The ability to locate pain plays a pivotal role in immediate defense and withdrawal behavior. However, how the brain localizes nociceptive information without additional information from somatotopically organized mechano-receptive pathways is not well understood. We used single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess hemodynamic responses to right and left painful stimulation. Thulium-YAG-(yttrium-aluminium-granate)-laser-evoked pain stimuli, without concomitant tactile component, were applied to either hand in a randomized order. A contralateral bias of the BOLD response was investigated to determine areas involved in the coding of the side of stimulation, which we observed in primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex, insula, and the thalamus. This suggests that these structures provide spatial information of selective nociceptive stimuli. More importantly, this contralateral bias of activation allowed functionally segregated activations within the SII complex, the insula, and the thalamus. Only distinct subregions of the SII complex, the posterior insula and the lateral thalamus, but not the remaining SII complex, the anterior insula and the medial thalamus, showed a contralaterally biased representation of painful stimuli. This result supports the hypothesis that sensory-discriminative attributes of painful stimuli, such as those related to body side, are topospeciﬁcally represented within the forebrain projections of the nociceptive system and highlights the concept of functional segregation and specialization within these structures.},

These theories make differing predictions about the degree of flexibility with which attention can be deployed in response to stimulus properties. Results from 2 eye-tracking studies show that humans can rapidly learn to differently allocate attention to members of different categories. These results provide the first unequivocal demonstration of stimulus-responsive attention in a categorization task. Furthermore, the authors found clear temporal patterns in the shifting of attention within trials that follow from the informativeness of particular stimulus features. These data provide new insights into the attention processes involved in categorization.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Structural brain imaging studies in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have produced inconsistent findings. This may be partially due to limited statistical power from relatively small samples and clinical heterogeneity related to variation in illness profile and developmental stage. To address these limitations, the authors conducted meta- and mega-analyses of data from OCD sites worldwide. METHOD: T(1) images from 1,830 OCD patients and 1,759 control subjects were analyzed, using coordinated and standardized processing, to identify subcortical brain volumes that differ between OCD patients and healthy subjects. The authors performed a meta-analysis on the mean of the left and right hemisphere measures of each subcortical structure, and they performed a mega-analysis by pooling these volumetric measurements from each site. The authors additionally examined potential modulating effects of clinical characteristics on morphological differences in OCD patients. RESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated that adult patients had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes (Cohen's d=-0.13; % difference=-2.80) and larger pallidum volumes (d=0.16; % difference=3.16) compared with adult controls. Both effects were stronger in medicated patients compared with controls (d=-0.29, % difference=-4.18, and d=0.29, % difference=4.38, respectively). Unmedicated pediatric patients had significantly larger thalamic volumes (d=0.38, % difference=3.08) compared with pediatric controls. None of these findings were mediated by sample characteristics, such as mean age or scanning field strength. The mega-analysis yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate different patterns of subcortical abnormalities in pediatric and adult OCD patients. The pallidum and hippocampus seem to be of importance in adult OCD, whereas the thalamus seems to be key in pediatric OCD. These findings highlight the potential importance of neurodevelopmental alterations in OCD and suggest that further research on neuroplasticity in OCD may be useful.},

   abstract = {Psychological experiments often yield data that are hierarchically structured. A number of popular shortcut strategies in cognitive modeling do not properly accommodate this structure and can result in biased conclusions. To gauge the severity of these biases, we conducted a simulation study for a two-group experiment. We first considered a modeling strategy that ignores the hierarchical data structure. In line with theoretical results, our simulations showed that Bayesian and frequentist methods that rely on this strategy are biased towards the null hypothesis. Secondly, we considered a modeling strategy that takes a two-step approach by first obtaining participant-level estimates from a hierarchical cognitive model and subsequently using these estimates in a follow-up statistical test. Methods that rely on this strategy are biased towards the alternative hypothesis. Only hierarchical models of the multilevel data lead to correct conclusions. Our results are particularly relevant for the use of hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimates in cognitive modeling.},

   abstract = {The contingent negative variation, a slow cortical potential, occurs when humans are warned by a stimulus about an upcoming task. The cognitive processes that give rise to this EEG potential are not yet well understood. To explain these processes, we adopt a recently developed theoretical framework from the area of perceptual decision-making. This framework assumes that the basal ganglia control the tradeoff between fast and accurate decision-making in the cortex. It suggests that an increase in cortical excitability serves to lower response caution, which results in faster but more error prone responding. We propose that the CNV reﬂects this increased cortical excitability. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an EEG experiment in which participants performed the random dot motion task either under speed or under accuracy stress. Our results show that trial-by-trial ﬂuctuations in participants' response speed as well as model-based estimates of response caution correlated with single-trial CNV amplitude under conditions of speed but not accuracy stress. We conclude that the CNV might reﬂect adjustments of response caution, which serves to enhance quick decision-making.},

   abstract = {Winner-take-all models are commonly used to model decision-making tasks where one outcome must be selected from several competing options. Related random walk and diffusion models have been used to explain such processes and apply them to psychometric and neurophysiological data. Recent model-based fMRI studies have sought to find the neural correlates of decision-making processes. However, due to the fact that hemodynamic responses likely reflect synaptic rather than spiking activity, the expected BOLD signature of winner-take-all circuits is not clear. A powerful way to integrate data from neurophysiology and brain imaging is by developing biologically plausible neural network models constrained and testable by neural and behavioral data, and then using Synthetic Brain Imaging — transforming the output of simulations with the model to make predictions testable against neuroimaging data. We developed a biologically realistic spiking winner-take-all model comprised of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neural populations. We varied the difficulty of a decision-making task by adjusting the contrast, or relative strength of inputs representing two response options. Synthetic brain imaging was used to estimate the BOLD response of the model and analyze its peak as a function of input contrast. We performed a parameter space analysis to determine values for which the model performs the task accurately, and given accurate performance, the distribution of the input contrast–BOLD response relationship. This underscores the need for models grounded in neurophysiological data for brain imaging analyses which attempt to localize the neural correlates of cognitive processes based on predicted BOLD responses.},

   abstract = {Models of categorization typically assume that all information sources are encoded by the learner. Models with attentional mechanisms then selectively weight these dimensions according to their relevance to support generalization. Unfortunately, encoding all potential information sources in high-dimensional environments is infeasible (e.g., making all possible eye movements or all possible web searches) and may be undesirable in lower dimensional environments. To address these and other shortcomings, we develop an active sampling model, Sampling Emergent Attention (SEA), which sequentially and strategically samples information sources until the expected cost of information exceeds the expected benefit. The model specifies the interplay of two components, one involved with determining the expected utility of information sources and the other with representing knowledge and beliefs about the environment. These two components interact such that knowledge of the world guides information sampling and what is sampled updates knowledge. Like human decision-makers, the model displays strategic sampling behavior, such as terminating information search when sufficient information sources have been sampled (i.e., fixated) and adaptively adjusting the search path in light of previously sampled information. The model also shows human-like failure modes. For example, when information exploitation is priortized over exploration the bidirectional influences of information-sampling and learning can lead to the development of beliefs that systematically deviate from reality. The model successfully captures several classic categorization results and the accompanying pattern of eye movements.},

These attentional biases apparently reflect the combined influence of feature enhancement and suppression. We examined the separate influence of enhancement and suppression in visual processing by determining whether responses to an unattended flicker were modulated when the flicker features matched target features at the attended location, competed with those features, or were neutral. We found that suppression primarily modulated parietal networks with a preferred frequency in the lower alpha band (f2 = 8 Hz), and enhancement primarily influenced parietal networks with a preferred frequency in the upper alpha band (f2 = 12 Hz). These responses were coupled with perception, with large responses to the unattended flicker leading to subsequently detected targets when the target features matched the flicker features (i.e., during enhancement). Our results suggest that enhancement and suppression are two distinct processes that work together to shape visual perception.},

   abstract = {Neuroeconomics refers to a combination of paradigms derived from neuroscience, psychology, and economics for the study of decision making and is an area that has received considerable scientific attention in the recent literature. Using realistic laboratory tasks, researchers seek to study the neurocognitive processes underlying economic decision making and outcome-based decision learning, as well as individual differences in these processes and the social and affective factors that modulate them. To this point, one question has remained largely unanswered: What happens to decision-making processes and their neural substrates during aging? After all, aging is associated with neurocognitive change, which may affect outcome-based decision making. In our study, we use the subjective expected utility model-a well-established decision-making model in economics-as a descriptive framework. After a short survey of the brain areas and neurotransmitter systems associated with outcome-based decision making-and of the effects of aging thereon-we review a number of decision-making studies. Their general data pattern indicates that the decision-making process is changed by age: The elderly perform less efficiently than younger participants, as demonstrated, for instance, by the smaller total rewards that the elderly acquire in lab tasks. These findings are accounted for in terms of age-related deficiencies in the probability and value parameters of the subjective expected utility model. Finally, we discuss some implications and suggestions for future research.},

These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from ﬁve previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven diﬃcult for other theoretical accounts.

   abstract = {As we navigate the world we learn about associations among events, extract relational structures, and store them in memory. This relational knowledge, in turn, enables generalization, inference, and hierarchical planning. Here we investigated relational knowledge during spatial navigation as multiscale predictive representations in the brain. We hypothesized that these representations are organized at multiple scales along posterior-anterior hierarchies in prefrontal and hippocampal regions. To test this, we conducted model-based representational similarity analyses of neuroimaging data measured during virtual reality navigation of familiar and unfamiliar paths with realistically long distances. We tested the pattern similarity of each point–along each navigational path–to a weighted sum of its successor points within different temporal horizons. Predictive similarity was significantly higher for familiar paths. Overall, anterior PFC showed predictive horizons at the largest scales (~875m) and posterior hippocampus at the lowest (~25m), while the anterior hippocampus (~175m), pre-polar PFC, and orbitofrontal regions (~350m) were in between. These findings support the idea that predictive representations are maintained at higher scales of abstraction in the anterior PFC, and unfolded at lower scales by pre-polar PFC and hippocampal regions. This representational hierarchy can support generalization, hierarchical planning, and subgoals at multiple scales.},

   abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala are both necessary for decisions based on expected outcomes. Although behavioral and imaging data suggest that these brain regions are affected by advanced age, the extent to which aging alters appetitive processes coordinated by the OFC and the amygdala is unknown. In the current experiment, young and aged bonnet macaques were trained on OFC- and amygdala-dependent tasks that test the degree to which response selection is guided by reward value and can be adapted when expected outcomes change. To assess whether the structural integrity of these regions varies with levels of performance on reward devaluation and object reversal tasks, volumes of areas 11/13 and 14 of the OFC, central/medial (CM), and basolateral (BL) nuclei of the amygdala were determined from high-resolution anatomical MRIs. With age, there were significant reductions in OFC, but not CM and BL, volume. Moreover, the aged monkeys showed impairments in the ability to associate an object with a higher value reward, and to reverse a previously learned association. Interestingly, greater OFC volume of area 11/13, but not 14, was significantly correlated with an animal's ability to anticipate the reward outcome associated with an object, and smaller BL volume was predictive of an animal's tendency to choose a higher value reward, but volume of neither region correlated with reversal learning. Together, these data indicate that OFC volume has an impact on monkeys' ability to guide choice behavior based on reward value but does not impact ability to reverse a previously learned association.},

   abstract = {Neuroimaging methodology predominantly relies on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. While the BOLD signal is a valid measure of neuronal activity, variance in fluctuations of the BOLD signal are not only due to fluctuations in neural activity. Thus, a remaining problem in neuroimaging analyses is developing methods that ensure specific inferences about neural activity that are not confounded by unrelated sources of noise in the BOLD signal. Here, we develop and test a new algorithm for performing semi-blind (i.e., no knowledge of stimulus timings) deconvolution of the BOLD signal that treats the neural event as an observable, but intermediate, probabilistic representation of the system’s state. We test and compare this new algorithm against three other recent deconvolution algorithms under varied levels of autocorrelated and Gaussian noise, hemodynamic response function (HRF) misspecification, and observation sampling rate (i.e., TR). Further, we compare the algorithms’ performance using two models to simulate BOLD data: a convolution of neural events with a known (or misspecified) HRF versus a biophysically accurate balloon model of hemodynamics. We also examine the algorithms’ performance on real task data. The results demonstrated good performance of all algorithms, though the new algorithm generally outperformed the others (3.0% improvement) under simulated resting state experimental conditions exhibiting multiple, realistic confounding factors (as well as 10.3% improvement on a real Stroop task). The simulations also demonstrate that the greatest negative influence on deconvolution accuracy is observation sampling rate. Practical and theoretical implications of these results for improving inferences about neural activity from fMRI BOLD signal are discussed.},

   abstract = {Abstract Much work has explored the possibility that the drift diffusion model, a model of response times and choices, could be extended to account for confidence reports. Many methods for making predictions from such models exist, although these methods either assume that stimuli are static over the course of a trial, or are computationally expensive, making it difficult to capitalise on trial-by-trial variability in dynamic stimuli. Using the framework of the drift diffusion model with time-dependent thresholds, and the idea of a Bayesian confidence readout, we derive expressions for the probability distribution over confidence reports. In line with current models of confidence, the derivations allow for the accumulation of “pipeline” evidence which has been received but not processed by the time of response, the effect of drift rate variability, and metacognitive noise. The expressions are valid for stimuli which change over the course of a trial with normally distributed fluctuations in the evidence they provide. A number of approximations are made to arrive at the final expressions, and we test all approximations via simulation. The derived expressions only contain a small number of standard functions, and only require evaluating once per trial, making trial-by-trial modelling of confidence data in dynamic stimuli tasks more feasible. We conclude by using the expressions to gain insight into the confidence of optimal observers, and empirically observed patterns.},

   institution = {PsyArXiv},
   type = {preprint},
   month = {2020/06/02/},
   abstract = {The drift diffusion model (DDM) provides an excellent account of decisions and response times. It also features the optimal property of tracking the difference in evidence between two options. However, the DDM struggles to account for human confidence reports, because responses are triggered when the difference in evidence reaches a set value, suggesting confidence in all decisions should be equal. Previously considered extensions to the DDM fall short of providing an adequate quantitative account of confidence. Possibly because of this, much confidence research has used non-normative models of the decision mechanism. Motivated by the idea that perceptual decision-making will reflect optimal computation, we consider 9 variants of the DDM. Motivated by the idea that the brain will not duplicate the representation of evidence, in all model variants confidence is read out from the decision mechanism. We compare the models to benchmark results, and make 4 qualitative predictions which we verify in a preregistered study. Modelling confidence on a trial-by-trial basis, we find that a subset of model variants provide an excellent account of the precise quantitative effects observed in confidence data. Specifically, models in which confidence reflects a miscalibrated Bayesian readout perform best. These results support the claim that confidence is based on the decision mechanism, which is itself optimal. Therefore, there is no need to abandon the idea that the implementation of perceptual decision-making will reflect optimal computation.},

   month = {2019/03/04/},
   abstract = {Even when choosing among a small set of alternatives, people don’t perfectly evaluate every option. Instead, decisions seem to be made on the basis of sequentially accumulated, noisy evidence. Previous research has suggested that the accumulation process is modulated by visual attention such that evidence accumulates more rapidly for attended items. But what guides attention itself? To answer this question, we formalize ﬁxations as a costly cognitive resource that a decision maker can dynamically allocate to evaluate her options before making a choice. We then approximate the optimal policy for allocating attention in the model, ﬁnding that ﬁxations are drawn to options whose value estimates are both high and uncertain. Comparing model predictions to human ﬁxation patterns in existing binary and trinary choice datasets, we ﬁnd that the model accounts for many previously identiﬁed e↵ects and we also conﬁrm several novel predictions. Together, our results suggest that the evolving state of the decision process inﬂuences the ﬁxation process in a way that is consistent with the optimal use of limited cognitive resources.},

We conduct a series of human category learning experiments inspired by a machine learning task for which active and passive learning error bounds are well understood, and dramatically distinct. Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries, and in doing so learn better and faster than if they are given random training data, as predicted by learning theory. However, the improvement over passive learning is not as dramatic as that achieved by machine active learning algorithms.

   pages = {3480-3486.e3},
   abstract = {Prediction errors are critical for associative learning [1, 2]. Transient changes in dopamine neuron activity correlate with positive and negative reward prediction errors and can mimic their effects [3–15]. However, although causal studies show that dopamine transients of 1–2 s are sufﬁcient to drive learning about reward, these studies do not address whether they are necessary (but see [11]). Further, the precise nature of this signal is not yet fully established. Although it has been equated with the cached-value error signal proposed to support model-free reinforcement learning, cached-value errors are typically confounded with errors in the prediction of reward features [16]. Here, we used optogenetic and transgenic approaches to prevent transient changes in midbrain dopamine neuron activity during the critical error-signaling period of two unblocking tasks. In one, learning was unblocked by increasing the number of rewards, a manipulation that induces errors in predicting both value and reward features. In another, learning was unblocked by switching from one to another equally valued reward, a manipulation that induces errors only in reward feature prediction. Preventing dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area from ﬁring for 5 s beginning before and continuing until after the changes in reward prevented unblocking of learning in both tasks. A similar duration suppression did not induce extinction when delivered during an expected reward, indicating that it did not act independently as a negative prediction error. This result suggests that dopamine transients play a general role in error signaling rather than being restricted to only signaling errors in value.},

   journal = {NeuroImage},
   volume = {59},
   number = {1},
   pages = {340-348},
   abstract = {Neuronal responses exhibit two stimulus or task-related components: evoked and induced. The functional role of induced responses has been ascribed to ‘top-down’ modulation through backward connections and lateral interactions; as opposed to the bottom-up driving processes that may predominate in evoked components. The implication is that evoked and induced components may reﬂect different neuronal processes. The conventional way of separating evoked and induced responses assumes that they can be decomposed linearly; in that induced responses are the average of the power minus the power of the average (the evoked component). However, this decomposition may not hold if both components are generated by nonlinear processes. In this work, we propose a Dynamic Causal Model that models evoked and induced responses at the same time. This allows us to explain both components in terms of shared mechanisms (coupling) and changes in coupling that are necessary to explain any induced components. To establish the face validity of our approach, we used Bayesian Model Selection to show that the scheme can disambiguate between models of synthetic data that did and did not contain induced components. We then repeated the analysis using MEG data during a hand grip task to ask whether induced responses in motor control circuits are mediated by ‘top-down’ or backward connections. Our result provides empirical evidence that induced responses are more likely to reﬂect backward message passing in the brain, while evoked and induced components share certain characteristics and mechanisms.},

The trade-off (Scholten, Read, & Sanborn, 2014) and the proportional difference models (González-Vallejo, 2002) were used to represent the attribute-wise mechanism. A stochastic version of the hyperbolic model based on Rachlin (2006) was adopted to represent the alternative-wise mechanism. Three experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, a typical intertemporal indifference choice task with a ﬁxed delayed amount was used. In Experiment 2, a general choice task with nonimmediate delays and varied attribute values was employed. The magnitude effect was embedded in this experiment. In Experiment 3, the models were tested with option sets designed to induce subadditive and superadditive choice patterns (Scholten & Read, 2006, 2010). In Experiment 1, the hyperbolic model performed as well as the other models. In Experiments 2 and 3, the attribute-wise models outperformed the alternative-wise model in terms of ﬁt, prediction, and handling of nonadditive patterns. The results support conclusions from recent studies (Dai & Busemeyer, 2014; Scholten et al., 2014), which suggest that attribute-wise mechanisms may be more suitable for describing intertemporal choices. Furthermore, the predictive performance was similar between the trade-off and the proportional difference (PD) models though the PD model is simpler.},

   abstract = {Attention is a core property of all perceptual and cognitive operations. Given limited capacity to process competing options, attentional mechanisms select, modulate, and sustain focus on information most relevant for behavior. A signiﬁcant problem, however, is that attention is so ubiquitous that it is unwieldy to study. We propose a taxonomy based on the types of information that attention operates over—the targets of attention. At the broadest level, the taxonomy distinguishes between external attention and internal attention. External attention refers to the selection and modulation of sensory information. External attention selects locations in space, points in time, or modality-speciﬁc input. Such perceptual attention can also select features deﬁned across any of these dimensions, or object representations that integrate over space, time, and modality. Internal attention refers to the selection, modulation, and maintenance of internally generated information, such as task rules, responses, long-term memory, or working memory. Working memory, in particular, lies closest to the intersection between external and internal attention. The taxonomy provides an organizing framework that recasts classic debates, raises new issues, and frames understanding of neural mechanisms.},

   volume = {40},

   pages = {608-627},
   abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted variability in response to theta burst stimulation (TBS) in humans. TBS paradigm was originally developed in rodents to mimic gamma bursts coupled with theta rhythms, and was shown to elicit long-term potentiation. The protocol was subsequently adapted for humans using standardised frequencies of stimulation. However, each individual has different rhythmic firing pattern. The present study sought to explore whether individualised intermittent TBS (Ind iTBS) could outperform the effects of two other iTBS variants. Twenty healthy volunteers received iTBS over left prefrontal cortex using 30 Hz at 6 Hz, 50 Hz at 5 Hz, or individualised frequency in separate sessions. Ind iTBS was determined using thetagamma coupling during the 3-back task. Concurrent use of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) was used to track changes in cortical plasticity. We also utilised mood ratings using a visual analogue scale and assessed working memory via the 3-back task before and after stimulation. No group-level effect was observed following either 30 or 50 Hz iTBS in TMS-EEG. Ind iTBS significantly increased the amplitude of the TMS-evoked P60, and decreased N100 and P200 amplitudes. A significant positive correlation between neurophysiological change and change in mood rating was also observed. Improved accuracy in the 3-back task was observed following both 50 Hz and Ind iTBS conditions. These findings highlight the critical importance of frequency in the parameter space of iTBS. Tailored stimulation parameters appear more efficacious than standard paradigms in neurophysiological and mood changes. This novel approach presents a promising option and benefits may extend to clinical applications.},

Experiment 1 shows that individual behavior is described best by a mixture of these two alternatives. In Experiment 2 we ﬁnd that people are able to adaptively alter their behavior and adopt the discriminatory model more often after experiencing that the conﬁrmatory strategy leads to a subjective performance decrement. In Experiment 3, time pressure leads to the opposite effect of inducing a change towards the simpler positive testing strategy. These ﬁndings suggest that there is no single strategy that describes how intervention decisions are made. Instead, people select strategies in an adaptive fashion that trades off their expected performance and cognitive effort.},

   journal = {Cognitive Psychology},
   volume = {98},
   pages = {45-72},
   abstract = {The ﬁrst aim of this research is to compare computational models of multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice when attribute values are explicit. The choice predictions of utility (standard random utility & weighted valuation), heuristic (elimination-by-aspects, lexicographic, & maximum attribute value), and dynamic (multi-alternative decision ﬁeld theory, MDFT, & a version of the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulator, MLBA) models are contrasted on both preferential and risky choice data. Using both maximum likelihood and cross-validation ﬁt measures on choice data, the utility and dynamic models are preferred over the heuristic models for risky choice, with a slight overall advantage for the MLBA for preferential choice. The response time predictions of these models (except the MDFT) are then tested. Although the MLBA accurately predicts response time distributions, it only weakly accounts for stimulus-level differences. The other models completely fail to account for stimulus-level differences. Process tracing measures, i.e., eye and mouse tracking, were also collected. None of the qualitative predictions of the models are completely supported by that data. These results suggest that the models may not appropriately represent the interaction of attention and preference formation. To overcome this potential shortcoming, the second aim of this research is to test preference-formation assumptions, independently of attention, by developing the models of attentional sampling (MAS) model family which incorporates the empirical gaze patterns into a sequential sampling framework. An MAS variant that includes attribute values, but only updates the currently viewed alternative and does not contrast values across alternatives, performs well in both experiments. Overall, the results support the dynamic models, but point to the need to incorporate a framework that more accurately reﬂects the relationship between attention and the preference-formation process.},

   abstract = {Steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) are rhythmic brain responses to rhythmic sensory stimulation, and are often used to study perceptual and attentional processes. We present a data analysis method for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow-band steady-state response in the frequency and time-frequency domains. The method, termed rhythmic entrainment source separation (RESS), is based on denoising source separation approaches that take advantage of the simultaneous but diﬀerential projection of neural activity to multiple electrodes or sensors. Our approach is a combination and extension of existing multivariate source separation methods. We demonstrate that RESS performs well on both simulated and empirical data, and outperforms conventional SSEP analysis methods based on selecting electrodes with the strongest SSEP response, as well as several other linear spatial ﬁlters. We also discuss the potential confound of overﬁtting, whereby the ﬁlter captures noise in absence of a signal. Matlab scripts are available to replicate and extend our simulations and methods. We conclude with some practical advice for optimizing SSEP data analyses and interpreting the results.},

   journal = {Nature Reviews Neuroscience},
   abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework of particular importance to psychology, neuroscience and machine learning. Interactions between these fields, as promoted through the common hub of RL, has facilitated paradigm shifts that relate multiple levels of analysis in a singular framework (for example, relating dopamine function to a computationally defined RL signal). Recently, more sophisticated RL algorithms have been proposed to better account for human learning, and in particular its oft-documented reliance on two separable systems: a model-based (MB) system and a model-free (MF) system. However, along with many benefits, this dichotomous lens can distort questions, and may contribute to an unnecessarily narrow perspective on learning and decision-making. Here, we outline some of the consequences that come from overconfidently mapping algorithms, such as MB versus MF RL, with putative cognitive processes. We argue that the field is well positioned to move beyond simplistic dichotomies, and we propose a means of refocusing research questions towards the rich and complex components that comprise learning and decision-making.},

Neural dynamics confirmed that increases in neural expectation were predictive of reduced neural surprise in the following feedback period, supporting central tenets of RL models. Within- and cross-trial dynamics revealed a cooperative interplay between systems for learning, in which WM contributes expectations to guide RL, despite competition between systems during choice. Together, these results provide a deeper understanding of how multiple neural systems interact for learning and decision-making and facilitate analysis of their disruption in clinical populations.},

   pages = {1571-1596},
   abstract = {This article examines relational category learning in light of 2 influential theories of concept acquisition: the structure-mapping theory of analogy and theories of feature-based category learning. According to current theories of analogy, comparing 2 instances of a relational concept enables alignment of their elements and reveals their shared relational structure. Therefore, learning relationally defined categories should be faster when comparing items of the same category than when comparing items of different categories. By contrast, feature-based theories predict a benefit of between-category comparisons, because such comparisons direct attention to the features that discriminate the categories. The present experiments tested these predictions using a 2-category classification-learning task in which 2 items are presented on every trial: either in the same category (match condition) or in different categories (contrast condition). Subjects in the contrast condition outperformed those in the match condition for feature-based categories (Experiment 1) and across 4 different types of relational categories (Experiments 1– 4). Although theorists have posited that structure-mapping theory is directly applicable to relational category learning, the present findings pose a distinct challenge to this assertion. We propose that many relational categories are learnable based solely on which relations are present in the stimulus rather than requiring explicitly compositional representations based on role-filler binding. This process would be akin to feature processing and would not require structural alignment. This theoretical proposal, together with the empirical results, may lead to a better understanding of when people do and do not engage in the cognitively demanding process of structural alignment.},

   volume = {7},
   abstract = {The ﬂuctuations in a brain region’s activation levels over a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-course are used in functional connectivity (FC) to identify networks with synchronous responses. It is increasingly recognized that multi-voxel activity patterns contain information that cannot be extracted from univariate activation levels. Here we present a novel analysis method that quantiﬁes regions’ synchrony in multi-voxel activity pattern discriminability, rather than univariate activation, across a timeseries. We introduce a measure of multi-voxel pattern discriminability at each time-point, which is then used to identify regions that share synchronous time-courses of condition-speciﬁc multi-voxel information. This method has the sensitivity and access to distributed information that multi-voxel pattern analysis enjoys, allowing it to be applied to data from conditions not separable by univariate responses. We demonstrate this by analyzing data collected while people viewed four different types of man-made objects (typically not separable by univariate analyses) using both FC and informational connectivity (IC) methods. IC reveals networks of object-processing regions that are not detectable using FC. The IC results support prior ﬁndings and hypotheses about object processing. This new method allows investigators to ask questions that are not addressable through typical FC, just as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has added new research avenues to those addressable with the general linear model (GLM).},

   abstract = {Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental failure even when all other experimental considerations have been addressed impeccably. In fMRI the combination of a large number of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been clearly addressed yet remains controversial—especially in regards to the expected effect sizes in fMRI, and especially for between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample sizes (n = 20–30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest. However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help address the power problem include model-based (multivariate) prediction methods and meta-analyses with related synthesis-oriented approaches.},

Many sophisticated models for behavioural and neurobiological data have flourished during the past decade.

   abstract = {Characterizing the cortical activity from electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG/MEG) data requires solving an ill-posed inverse problem that does not admit a unique solution. As a consequence, the use of functional neuroimaging, for instance, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), constitutes an appealing way of constraining the solution. However, the match between bioelectric and metabolic activities is desirable but not assured. Therefore, the introduction of spatial priors derived from other functional modalities in the EEG/MEG inverse problem should be considered with caution. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian characterization of the relevance of fMRI-derived prior information regarding the EEG/MEG data. This is done by quantifying the adequacy of this prior to the data, compared with that obtained using an noninformative prior instead. This quantitative comparison, using the so-called Bayes factor, allows us to decide whether the informative prior should (or not) be included in the inverse solution. We validate our approach using extensive simulations, where fMRI-derived priors are built as perturbed versions of the simulated EEG sources. Moreover, we show how this inference framework can be generalized to optimize the way we should incorporate the informative prior.},

   abstract = {Characterizing the cortical activity sources of electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography data is a critical issue since it requires solving an ill-posed inverse problem that does not admit a unique solution. Two main different and complementary source models have emerged: equivalent current dipoles (ECD) and distributed linear (DL) models. While ECD models remain highly popular since they provide an easy way to interpret the solutions, DL models (also referred to as imaging techniques) are known to be more realistic and flexible. In this paper, we show how those two representations of the brain electromagnetic activity can be cast into a common general framework yielding an optimal description and estimation of the EEG sources. From this extended source mixing model, we derive a hybrid approach whose key aspect is the separation between temporal and spatial characteristics of brain activity, which allows to dramatically reduce the number of DL model parameters. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the sources, as a temporal invariant map, is estimated using the entire time window data, allowing to significantly enhance the information available about the spatial aspect of the EEG inverse problem. A Bayesian framework is introduced to incorporate distinct temporal and spatial constraints on the solution and to estimate both parameters and hyperparameters of the model. Using simulated EEG data, the proposed inverse approach is evaluated and compared with standard distributed methods using both classical criteria and ROC curves.},

   abstract = {Category learning is a complex phenomenon that engages multiple cognitive processes, many of which occur simultaneously and unfold dynamically over time. For example, as people encounter objects in the world, they simultaneously engage processes to determine their fit with current knowledge structures, gather new information about the objects, and adjust their representations to support behavior in future encounters. Many techniques that are available to understand the neural basis of category learning assume that the multiple processes that subserve it can be neatly separated between different trials of an experiment. Model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising tool to separate multiple, simultaneously occurring processes and bring the analysis of neuroimaging data more in line with category learning’s dynamic and multifaceted nature. We use model-based imaging to explore the neural basis of recognition and entropy signals in the medial temporal lobe and striatum that are engaged while participants learn to categorize novel stimuli. Consistent with theories suggesting a role for the anterior hippocampus and ventral striatum in motivated learning in response to uncertainty, we find that activation in both regions correlates with a model-based measure of entropy. Simultaneously, separate subregions of the hippocampus and striatum exhibit activation correlated with a model-based recognition strength measure. Our results suggest that model-based analyses are exceptionally useful for extracting information about cognitive processes from neuroimaging data. Models provide a basis for identifying the multiple neural processes that contribute to behavior, and neuroimaging data can provide a powerful test bed for constraining and testing model predictions.},

   abstract = {The mesostriatal dopamine system is prominently implicated in model-free reinforcement learning, with fMRI BOLD signals in ventral striatum notably covarying with model-free prediction errors. However, latent learning and devaluation studies show that behavior also shows hallmarks of model-based planning, and the interaction between model-based and model-free values, prediction errors, and preferences is underexplored. We designed a multistep decision task in which modelbased and model-free inﬂuences on human choice behavior could be distinguished. By showing that choices reﬂected both inﬂuences we could then test the purity of the ventral striatal BOLD signal as a model-free report. Contrary to expectations, the signal reﬂected both model-free and modelbased predictions in proportions matching those that best explained choice behavior. These results challenge the notion of a separate model-free learner and suggest a more integrated computational architecture for high-level human decisionmaking.},

   abstract = {The present series of three studies aims at investigating the hypothesis that some seemingly normal older persons have deficits in reasoning and decision making due to dysfunction in a neural system which includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortices. This hypothesis is relevant to the comprehensive study of aging, and also addresses the question of why so many older adults fall prey to fraud. To our knowledge, this work represents the first of its kind to begin to identify, from an individual-differences perspective, the behavioral, psychophysiological, and consumer correlates of defective decision making among healthy older adults. Our findings, in a cross-sectional sample of community-dwelling participants, demonstrate that a sizeable subset of older adults (approximately 35-40%) perform disadvantageously on a laboratory measure of decision making that closely mimics everyday life, by the manner in which it factors in reward, punishment, risk, and ambiguity. These same poor decision makers display defective autonomic responses (or somatic markers), reminiscent of that previously established in patients with acquired prefrontal lesions. Finally, we present data demonstrating that poor decision makers are more likely to fall prey to deceptive advertising, suggesting compromise of real-world judgment and decision-making abilities.},

   abstract = {How do people learn categories and what changes with development? The current study attempts to address these questions by focusing on the role of attention in the development of categorization. In Experiment 1, participants (adults, 7-year-olds, and 4-year-olds) were trained with novel categories consisting of deterministic and probabilistic features, and their categorization and memory for features were tested. In Experiment 2, participants’ attention was directed to the deterministic feature, and in Experiment 3 it was directed to the probabilistic features. Attentional cueing affected categorization and memory in adults and 7-year-olds: these participants relied on the cued features in their categorization and exhibited better memory of cued than of non-cued features. In contrast, in 4-year-olds attentional cueing affected only categorization, but not memory: these participants exhibited equally good memory for both cued and non-cued features. Furthermore, across the experiments, 4-year-olds remembered non-cued features better than adults. These results coupled with computational simulations provide novel evidence (1) pointing to differences in category representation and mechanisms of categorization across development, (2) elucidating the role of attention in the development of categorization, and (3) suggesting an important distinction between representation and decision factors in categorization early in development. These issues are discussed with respect to theories of categorization and its development.},

   abstract = {Transcranial stimulation of the human motor cortex can evoke several different kinds of descending activity depending on the type of stimulation, the intensity of stimulation and the area of the cortex being stimulated. Thus, transcranial magnetic stimulation preferentially activates different structures than transcranial electrical stimulation. In addition, the response to magnetic stimulation depends on the direction of the induced current in the brain, the waveform of the stimulating current, and the shape of the coil. Stimulation of the lower limb area of motor cortex recruits different elements than stimulation of the upper limb area. These differences occur because different structures in the motor cortex have a differential threshold to the different techniques of stimulation. We have had the opportunity to perform a series of direct recordings of the corticospinal volley evoked by the different techniques of transcranial stimulation from the epidural space of conscious patients with chronically implanted spinal electrodes. These recordings provide insights about the physiological basis of the excitatory and inhibitory phenomena produced by transcranial stimulation.},

   pages = {559-571},
   abstract = {Cerebral plasticity-inducing approaches like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are of high interest in situations where reorganization of neural networks can be observed, e.g., after stroke. However, an increasing number of studies suggest that improvements in motor performance of the stroke-aﬀected hand following modulation of primary motor cortex (M1) excitability by rTMS shows a high interindividual variability. We here tested the hypothesis that in stroke patients the interindividual variability of behavioral response to excitatory rTMS is related to interindividual diﬀerences in network connectivity of the stimulated region. Chronic stroke patients (n = 14) and healthy controls (n = 12) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a simple hand motor task. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to investigate eﬀective connectivity of key motor regions. On two diﬀerent days after the fMRI experiment, patients received either intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over ipsilesional M1 or control stimulation over the parieto-occipital cortex. Motor performance and TMS parameters of cortical excitability were measured before and after iTBS. Our results revealed that patients with better motor performance of the aﬀected hand showed stronger endogenous coupling between supplemental motor area (SMA) and M1 before starting the iTBS intervention. Applying iTBS to ipsilesional M1 signiﬁcantly increased ipsilesional M1 excitability and decreased contralesional M1 excitability as compared to control stimulation. Individual behavioral improvements following iTBS speciﬁcally correlated with neural coupling strengths in the stimulated hemisphere prior to stimulation, especially for connections targeting the stimulated M1. Combining endogenous connectivity and behavioral parameters explained 82% of the variance in hand motor performance observed after iTBS. In conclusion, the data suggest that the individual susceptibility to iTBS after stroke is inﬂuenced by interindividual diﬀerences in motor network connectivity of the lesioned hemisphere.},

Studies focusing exclusively on tobacco-smoking and gambling were excluded. Results Fifty-two research articles were evaluated.Most studies showed significant deficits in decision-making in people with substance use disorders. A consistent finding in the neuroimaging studies was hypoactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex after detoxification. The association between hyperactivity of this region and craving or cue reactivity was not consistent across studies. Conclusions The orbitofrontal cortex has an important role in addictive behaviours.Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying neuronal substrates of cue reactivity, craving and decision-making, and the implications for treatment and relapse prevention.},

   abstract = {Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is an increasingly popular approach for characterizing the information present in neural activity as measured by fMRI. For neuroimaging researchers, the searchlight technique serves as the most intuitively appealing means of implementing MVPA with fMRI data. However, searchlight approaches carry with them a number of special concerns and limitations that can lead to serious interpretation errors in practice, such as misidentifying a cluster as informative, or failing to detect truly informative voxels. Here we describe how such distorted results can occur, using both schematic illustrations and examples from actual fMRI datasets. We recommend that conﬁrmatory and sensitivity tests, such as the ones prescribed here, should be considered a necessary stage of searchlight analysis interpretation, and that their adoption will allow the full potential of searchlight analysis to be realized.},

   institution = {PsyArXiv},
   type = {preprint},
   month = {2019/01/21/},
   abstract = {Psychology research has become increasingly focused on creating formalized models of psychological processes, which can make exact quantitative predictions about observed data that are the result of some unknown psychological process, allowing a better understanding of how psychological processes may actually operate. However, using models to understand psychological processes comes with an additional challenge: how do we select the best model from a range of potential models that all aim to explain the same psychological process? A recent article by Navarro (2019; Computational Brain & Behavior) provided a detailed discussion on several broad issues within the area of model selection, with Navarro suggesting that “one of the most important functions of a scientiﬁc theory is ... to encourage directed exploration of new territory” (p.30), that “understanding how the qualitative patterns in the empirical data emerge naturally from a computational model of a psychological process is often more scientiﬁcally useful than presenting a quantiﬁed measure of its performance” (p.33), and that “quantitative measures of performance are essentially selecting models based on their ancillary assumptions” (p.33). Here, I provide a critique of several of Navarro’s points on these broad issues. In contrast to Navarro, I argue that all possible data should be considered when evaluating a process model (i.e., not just data from novel contexts), that quantitative model selection methods provide a more principled and complete method of selecting between process models than visual assessments of qualitative trends, and that the idea of ancillary assumptions that are not part of the core explanation in the model is a slippery slope to an inﬁnitely ﬂexible model.},

   abstract = {The ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a central role in the neural circuit control of behavioral reinforcement. Though considered a dopaminergic nucleus, the VTA contains substantial heterogeneity in neurotransmitter type, containing also GABA and glutamate neurons. Here, we used a combinatorial viral approach to transsynaptically label afferents to defined VTA dopamine, GABA, or glutamate neurons. Surprisingly, we find that these populations received qualitatively similar inputs, with dominant and comparable projections from the lateral hypothalamus, raphe, and ventral pallidum. However, notable differences were observed, with striatal regions and globus pallidus providing a greater share of input to VTA dopamine neurons, cortical input preferentially on to glutamate neurons, and GABA neurons receiving proportionally more input from the lateral habenula and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. By comparing inputs to each of the transmitter-defined VTA cell types, this study sheds important light on the systems-level organization of diverse inputs to VTA.},

   abstract = {Standard social choice experiments generally force subjects to make decisions about giving money to another person, but the ability to avoid information outside of the lab could lead to less altruistic or fair behavior than such experiments tend to suggest. I expand on the design of Dana, Weber, and Kuang (2007) to better study information avoidance in an experimental setting. Subjects are given the chance to avoid information about a recipient’s payoffs in a dictator game. I vary the probability that a dictator’s payoffs will be aligned with the recipient’s in order to assess the role of beliefs on avoidance and test contradictory models. The within-subjects approach shows that even people who are generous in a stark choice will make self-serving decisions when they can avoid knowing the recipient’s outcome. People avoid information more often when the self-serving choice is unlikely to hurt the recipient, which supports Rabin’s model (1995) of moral rules and moral preferences. Ó 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They argue that the exploitation of the informational value of base rates underlying PCs offers an alternative perspective on many phenomena in the realm of adaptive cognition that have been studied in isolation so far. Although PCs can lead to serious biases under some conditions, they afford an efficient strategy for inductive inference making in probabilistic environments that render base-rate information, rather than genuine covariation information, readily available.},

   abstract = {The ability to extract statistical contingencies (e.g., between cause and effect, between response and feedback) is commonly presupposed as a basic module of adaptive behavior. In reality, however, stimulus input rarely contains the complete sets of correlated attributes required to assess the actual contingencies. Instead, cognitive inferences often rely on a base-rate-driven pseudocontingency rule, which links the more (or less) frequent level of one variable to the more (or less) frequent level of the other variable. Empirical evidence shows that logically unwarranted pseudocontingency inferences override genuine contingencies across many research paradigms. Although pseudocontingencies can be severely misleading, they also provide a useful proxy that accurately predicts existing contingencies most of the time.},

In a series of field studies involving over 1,200 participants across six multiday mass gatherings in the United States and the United Kingdom, we investigated the effects of psychedelic substance use on transformative experience, social connectedness, and positive mood. This approach allowed us to test preregistered hypotheses with high ecological validity and statistical precision. Controlling for a host of demographic variables and the use of other psychoactive substances, we found that psychedelic substance use was significantly associated with positive mood—an effect sequentially mediated by self-reported transformative experience and increased social connectedness. These effects were particularly pronounced for those who had taken psychedelic substances within the last 24 h (compared to the last week). Overall, this research provides robust evidence for positive affective and social consequences of psychedelic substance use in naturalistic settings.},

In particular, we introduce a new decision moving-window paradigm that presents stimulus information contingent on eye ﬁxations. We provide data from the ﬁrst application of this method to risky decision making, and show how it compares to basic eye-tracking and mouse-tracing methods. We also enumerate the practical, theoretical, and analytic advantages this method offers above and beyond both mouse-tracing with occlusion and basic eye tracking of information without occlusion. We include the use of new metrics that offer more precision than those typically calculated on mouse-tracing data as well as those not possible or feasible within the mouse-tracing paradigm.},

   institution = {PsyArXiv},
   type = {preprint},
   month = {2020/02/07/},
   abstract = {The last decade has brought reforms to improve methodological practices, with the goal to increase the reliability and replicability of effects. However, explanations of effects remain scarce, and a growing chorus of scholars argues that the replicability crisis has distracted from a crisis of theory. In the same decade, the empirical literature using factor and network models has grown rapidly. I discuss three ways in which this literature falls short of theory building and testing. First, statistical and theoretical models are conflated, leading to invalid inferences such as the existence of psychological constructs based on factor models, or recommendations for clinical interventions based on network models. I demonstrate this inferential gap in a simulation study on statistical equivalence: excellent model fit does little to corroborate a theory, regardless of quality or quantity of data. Second, researchers fail to explicate theories about psychological constructs, but use implicit causal beliefs to guide inferences. These latent theories have led to problematic best practices in psychological research where inferences are drawn based on one specific causal model that is assumed, but not explicated. Third, explicated theories are often weak theories: narrative and imprecise descriptions vulnerable to hidden assumptions and unknowns. They fail to make clear predictions, and it remains unclear whether statistical effects corroborate such theories or not. Weak theories are immune to refutation or revision. I argue that these three challenges to theory building and testing are common and harmful, and impede theory formation, failure, and reform. A renewed focus on theoretical psychology and formal models offers a way forward.},

   title = {Dynamic causal modelling revisited},
   journal = {NeuroImage},
   abstract = {This paper revisits the dynamic causal modelling of fMRI timeseries by replacing the usual (Taylor) approximation to neuronal dynamics with a neural mass model of the canonical microcircuit. This provides a generative or dynamic causal model of laminar speciﬁc responses that can generate haemodynamic and electrophysiological measurements. In principle, this allows the fusion of haemodynamic and (event related or induced) electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, it enables Bayesian model comparison of competing hypotheses about physiologically plausible synaptic eﬀects; for example, does attentional modulation act on superﬁcial or deep pyramidal cells – or both? In this technical note, we describe the resulting dynamic causal model and provide an illustrative application to the attention to visual motion dataset used in previous papers. Our focus here is on how to answer long-standing questions in fMRI; for example, do haemodynamic responses reﬂect extrinsic (aﬀerent) input from distant cortical regions, or do they reﬂect intrinsic (recurrent) neuronal activity? To what extent do inhibitory interneurons contribute to neurovascular coupling? What is the relationship between haemodynamic responses and the frequency of induced neuronal activity? This paper does not pretend to answer these questions; rather it shows how they can be addressed using neural mass models of fMRI timeseries.},

Particular emphasis is given to emerging research that facilitates wide comparison of feature-based representations that allow us to understand the properties of a time-series dataset that make it suited to a particular feature-based representation or analysis algorithm.

   abstract = {Probing how large populations of neurons represent stimuli is key to understanding sensory representations as many stimulus characteristics can only be discerned from population activity and not from individual single-units. Recently, inverted encoding models have been used to produce channel response functions from large spatialscale measurements of human brain activity that are reminiscent of single-unit tuning functions and have been proposed to assay “population-level stimulus representations” (Sprague et al., 2018a). However, these channel response functions do not assay population tuning. We show by derivation that the channel response function is only determined up to an invertible linear transform. Thus, these channel response functions are arbitrary, one of an infinite family and therefore not a unique description of population representation. Indeed, simulations demonstrate that bimodal, even random, channel basis functions can account perfectly well for population responses without any underlying neural response units that are so tuned. However, the approach can be salvaged by extending it to reconstruct the stimulus, not the assumed model. We show that when this is done, even using bimodal and random channel basis functions, a unimodal function peaking at the appropriate value of the stimulus is recovered which can be interpreted as a measure of population selectivity. More precisely, the recovered function signifies how likely any value of the stimulus is, given the observed population response. Whether an analysis is recovering the hypothetical responses of an arbitrary model rather than assessing the selectivity of population representations is not an issue unique to the inverted encoding model and human neuroscience, but a general problem that must be confronted as more complex analyses intervene between measurement of population activity and presentation of data.},

A combination of Bayes analyses and standard regressions revealed that the age at which the children had the conceptual insight that number words represent specific quantities (cardinal value) was strongly related to their later number-system knowledge and was more consistently related to broader mathematics than to reading achievement, controlling for intelligence, executive function, and parental education levels. The key implication is that it is not simply knowledge of cardinal value but the age of acquisition of this principle that is central to later mathematical development and school readiness.},

   abstract = {Glutamatergic inputs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), thought crucial to the capacity of the VTA to detect and signal stimulus salience, have been reported to arise in but a few structures. However, the afferent system of the VTA comprises very abundant neurons within a large formation extending from the prefrontal cortex to the caudal brainstem. Neurons in nearly all parts of this continuum may be glutamatergic and equivalently important to VTA function. Thus, we sought to identify the full range of glutamatergic inputs to the VTA by combining retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-bound gold after injections into the VTA with nonisotopic in situ hybridization of the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1, 2, and 3. We found glutamatergic neurons innervating the VTA in almost all structures projecting there and that a majority of these are subcortical and VGLUT2 mRNA positive. The tremendous convergence of glutamatergic afferents from many brain areas in the VTA suggests that (1) the function of the VTA requires integration of manifold and diverse bits of information and (2) the activity of the VTA reflects the ongoing activities of various combinations of its afferents.},

The model, topographic latent source analysis (TLSA), assumes that fMRI images are generated by a covariate-dependent superposition of latent sources. These sources are deﬁned in terms of basis functions over space. The number of parameters in the model does not depend on the number of voxels, enabling a parsimonious description of activity patterns that avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional voxel-based approaches. We develop a multi-subject extension where latent sources at the subject-level are perturbations of a group-level template. We evaluate TLSA according to prediction, reconstruction and reproducibility. We show that it compares favorably to a Naive Bayes model while using fewer parameters. We also describe a hypothesis testing framework that can be used to identify signiﬁcant latent sources.},

   abstract = {Many everyday decisions have to be made under risk and can be interpreted as choices between gambles with different outcomes that are realized with speciﬁc probabilities. The underlying cognitive processes were investigated by testing six sets of hypotheses concerning choices, decision times, and information search derived from cumulative prospect theory, decision ﬁeld theory, priority heuristic and parallel constraint satisfaction models. Our participants completed 40 decision tasks of two gambles with two non-negative outcomes each. Information search was recorded using eye-tracking technology. Results for choices, decision time, the amount of information searched for, ﬁxation durations, the direction of the information search, and the distribution of ﬁxations conﬂict with the prediction of the non-compensatory priority heuristic and indicate that individuals use compensatory strategies. Choice proportions are well in line with the predictions of cumulative prospect theory. Process measures indicate that individuals thereby do not rely on deliberate calculations of weighted sums. Information integration processes seem to be better explained by models that partially rely on automatic processes such as decision ﬁeld theory or parallel constraint satisfaction models.

   journal = {eLife},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {e39659},
   abstract = {Humans and other animals often violate economic principles when choosing between multiple alternatives, but the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain elusive. A robust finding is that adding a third option can alter the relative preference for the original alternatives, but studies disagree on whether the third option’s value decreases or increases accuracy. To shed light on this controversy, we used and extended the paradigm of one study reporting a positive effect. However, our four experiments with 147 human participants and a reanalysis of the original data revealed that the positive effect is neither replicable nor reproducible. In contrast, our behavioral and eye-tracking results are best explained by assuming that the third option’s value captures attention and thereby impedes accuracy. We propose a computational model that accounts for the complex interplay of value, attention, and choice. Our theory explains how choice sets and environments influence the neurocognitive processes of multi-alternative decision making. , A man in a restaurant is offered a choice between apple or blueberry pie, and chooses apple. The waiter then returns a few moments later and tells him they also have cherry pie available. “In that case”, replies the man, “I’ll have blueberry”. This well-known anecdote illustrates a principle in economics and psychology called the independence principle. This states that preferences between two options should not change when a third option becomes available. A person who prefers apple over blueberry pie should continue to do so regardless of whether cherry pie is also on the menu. But, as in the anecdote, people often violate the independence principle when making decisions. One example is voting. People may vote for a candidate who would not usually be their first choice only because there is also a similar but clearly less preferable candidate available. Such behavior provides clues to the mechanisms behind making decisions. Studies show, for example, that when people have to choose between two options, introducing a desirable third option that cannot be selected – a distractor – alters what decision they make. But the studies disagree on whether the distractor improves or impairs performance. Gluth et al. now resolve this controversy using tasks in which people had to choose between rectangles on a computer screen for the chance to win different amounts of money. Contrary to a previous study, their four experiments showed that a high-value distractor did not change how likely the volunteers were to select one of the two available options over the other. Instead, the distractor slowed down the entire decision-making process. Moreover, volunteers often selected the high-value distractor despite knowing that they could not have it. One explanation for such behavior is that high-value items capture our attention automatically even when they are irrelevant to our goals. If a person likes chocolate cake, their attention will immediately be drawn to a cake in a shop window, even if they had no plans to buy a cake. Eye-tracking data confirmed that volunteers in the above experiments spent more time looking at high-value items than low-value ones. Those volunteers whose gaze was distracted the most by high-value items also made the worst decisions. Based on the new data, Gluth et al. developed and tested a mathematical model. The model describes how we make decisions, and how attention influences this process. It provides insights into the interplay between attention, valuation and choice – particularly when we make decisions under time pressure. Such insights may enable us to improve decision-making environments where people must choose quickly between many options. These include emergency medicine, road traffic situations, and the stock market. To achieve this goal, findings from the current study need to be tested under more naturalistic conditions.},

   volume = {5},
   abstract = {A signiﬁcant body of literature supports the contention that pupil size varies depending on cognitive load, affective state, and level of drowsiness. Here we assessed whether oculometric measures such as gaze position, blink frequency and pupil size were correlated with the occurrence and time course of self-reported mind-wandering episodes. We recorded the pupil size of two subjects engaged in a monotonous breath counting task while keeping their eyes on a ﬁxation cross. This task is conducive to producing mindwandering episodes. Each subject performed ten 20-min sessions, for total duration of about 4 h. Subjects were instructed to report spontaneous mind-wandering episodes by pressing a button when they lost count of their breath. After each button press, subjects ﬁlled in a short questionnaire describing the characteristics of their mind-wandering episode. We observed larger pupil size during the breath-focusing period compared to the mind-wandering period (p < 0.01 for both subjects). Our ﬁndings contradict previous research showing a higher baseline pupil size during mind wandering episodes in visual tasks. We discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy. We also analyzed nine other oculometric measures including blink rate, blink duration and gaze position. We built a support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer and showed that mean pupil size was the most reliable predictor of mind wandering in both subjects. The classiﬁcation accuracy of mind wandering data segments vs. breath-focusing data segments was 81% for the ﬁrst subject and 77% for the second subject. Additionally, we analyzed oculometric measures in light of the phenomenological data collected in the questionnaires. We showed that how well subjects remembered their thoughts while mind wandering was positively correlated with pupil size (subject 1, p < 0.001; subject 2, p < 0.05). Feelings of well being were also positively correlated with pupil size (subject 1, p < 0.001; subject 2, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that oculometric data could be used as a neurocognitive marker of mind-wandering episodes.},

In order to control for generalized de®cits related to choice and planning, subjects were also administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Thirty polysubstance abusers were compared to a comparison group of 24 subjects who did not use illicit drugs of abuse. Drug abusers performed much more poorly on the Gambling Task (net score = 10.224.7, mean2s.e.m.) than controls (26.025.3), but did not dier from controls on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. The results show that drug abusers are more likely to make maladaptive decisions in the Gambling Task that result in long-term losses exceeding short-term gains.

   abstract = {Data derived from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies suggest that transcallosal inhibition mechanisms between the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres may contribute to the reduced motor performance of stroke patients. We here investigated the potential of modulating pathological interactions between cortical motor areas by means of repetitive TMS using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Eleven subacute stroke patients were scanned 1–3 months after symptom onset while performing whole hand ﬁst closure movements. After a baseline scan, patients were stimulated with inhibitory 1-Hz rTMS applied over two different locations: (i) vertex (control stimulation) and (ii) primary motor cortex (M1) of the unaffected (contralesional) hemisphere. Changes in the endogenous and task-dependent effective connectivity were assessed by DCM of a bilateral network comprising M1, lateral premotor cortex, and the supplementary motor area (SMA). The results showed that rTMS applied over contralesional M1 signiﬁcantly improved the motor performance of the paretic hand. The connectivity analysis revealed that the behavioral improvements were signiﬁcantly correlated with a reduction of the negative inﬂuences originating from contralesional M1 during paretic hand movements. Concurrently, endogenous coupling between ipsilesional SMA and M1 was signiﬁcantly enhanced only after rTMS applied over contralesional M1. Therefore, rTMS applied over contralesional M1 may be used to transiently remodel the disturbed functional network architecture of the motor system. The connectivity analyses suggest that both a reduction of pathological transcallosal inﬂuences (originating from contralesional M1) and a restitution of ipsilesional effective connectivity between SMA and M1 underlie improved motor performance.},

The ideal CCN model should not make any assumptions that are known to contradict the current neuroscience literature and at the same time provide good accounts of behavior and at least some neuroscience data (e.g., singleneuron activity, fMRI data). Furthermore, once set, the architecture of the CCN network and the models of each individual unit should remain fixed throughout all applications. Because of the greater weight they place on biological accuracy, CCN models differ substantially from traditional neural network models in how each individual unit is modeled, how learning is modeled, and how behavior is generated from the network. A variety of CCN solutions to these three problems are described. A real example of this approach is described, and some advantages and limitations of the CCN approach are discussed.},

   abstract = {Across the empirical sciences, few statistical procedures rival the popularity of the frequentist t-test. In contrast, the Bayesian versions of the t-test have languished in obscurity. In recent years, however, the theoretical and practical advantages of the Bayesian t-test have become increasingly apparent. Developed by Harold Jeﬀreys, the default Bayesian t-test assigns a zero-centered Cauchy prior distribution to the eﬀect size parameter under the alternative hypothesis. This speciﬁcation is relatively restrictive, and in scientiﬁc applications the researcher may possess expert knowledge that allows the formulation of an informed prior distribution that is centered away from zero. In order to facilitate a more informative Bayesian analysis of the comparison between two means we extend Harold Jeﬀreys’s t-tests. This extension allows researchers to assign a shifted and scaled t prior distribution to the eﬀect size parameter. We present expressions for the marginal posterior distribution of the eﬀect size parameter and for the Bayes factor test; three real-data examples highlight the practical value of the approach.},

   abstract = {Cross-validation (CV) is increasingly popular as a generic method to adjudicate between mathematical models of cognition and behavior. In order to measure model generalizability, CV quantifies out-of-sample predictive performance, and the CV preference goes to the model that predicted the out-of-sample data best. The advantages of CV include theoretic simplicity and practical feasibility. Despite its prominence, however, the limitations of CV are often underappreciated. Here, we demonstrate the limitations of a particular form of CV—Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation or LOO—with three concrete examples. In each example, a data set of infinite size is perfectly in line with the predictions of a simple model (i.e., a general law or invariance). Nevertheless, LOO shows bounded and relatively modest support for the simple model. We conclude that CV is not a panacea for model selection.},

We hypothesized that brain network dynamics might be a more sensitive measure of WMC-related differences in cognitive control abilities. Thus, in the present study, we measured human EEG during the Simon task to characterize WMC-related differences in the neural dynamics of conﬂict processing and adaptation to conﬂict. Although high- and low-WMC individuals did not differ behaviorally, there were substantial WMC-related differences in theta (4–8 Hz) and delta (1–3 Hz) connectivity in fronto-parietal networks. Group differences in local theta and delta power were relatively less pronounced.These results suggest that the relationship between WMC and cognitive control abilities is more strongly reﬂected in large-scale oscillatory network dynamics than in spatially localized activity or in behavioral task performance.},

But in daily life, we often use past experiences to guide our attentional states. Given the importance of memory for predicting upcoming events, we hypothesized that memoryguided attention is supported by neural preparation for anticipated attentional states. We examined preparatory coding in the human hippocampus and mPFC, two regions that are important for memoryguided behaviors, in two tasks — one where attention was guided by memory and another in which attention was explicitly instructed. Hippocampus and mPFC exhibited higher activity for memoryguided vs. explicitly instructed attention. Furthermore, representations in both regions contained information about upcoming attentional states. In the hippocampus, this preparation was stronger for memory-guided attention, and occurred alongside stronger coupling with visual cortex during attentional guidance. These results highlight the mechanisms by which memories are used to prepare for upcoming attentional goals.},

   journal = {NeuroImage},
   volume = {122},
   pages = {355-372},
   abstract = {The functional MRI (fMRI) signal is an indirect measure of neuronal activity. In order to deconvolve the neuronal activity from the experimental fMRI data, biophysical generative models have been proposed describing the link between neuronal activity and the cerebral blood ﬂow (the neurovascular coupling), and further the hemodynamic response and the BOLD signal equation. These generative models have been employed both for single brain area deconvolution and to infer effective connectivity in networks of multiple brain areas. In the current paper, we introduce a new fMRI model inspired by experimental observations about the physiological underpinnings of the BOLD signal and compare it with the generative models currently used in dynamic causal modeling (DCM), a widely used framework to study effective connectivity in the brain. We consider three fundamental aspects of such generative models for fMRI: (i) an adaptive two-state neuronal model that accounts for a wide repertoire of neuronal responses during and after stimulation; (ii) feedforward neurovascular coupling that links neuronal activity to blood ﬂow; and (iii) a balloon model that can account for vascular uncoupling between the blood ﬂow and the blood volume. Finally, we adjust the parameterization of the BOLD signal equation for different magnetic ﬁeld strengths. This paper focuses on the form, motivation and phenomenology of DCMs for fMRI and the characteristics of the various models are demonstrated using simulations. These simulations emphasize a more accurate modeling of the transient BOLD responses — such as adaptive decreases to sustained inputs during stimulation and the post-stimulus undershoot. In addition, we demonstrate using experimental data that it is necessary to take into account both neuronal and vascular transients to accurately model the signal dynamics of fMRI data. By reﬁning the models of the transient responses, we provide a more informed perspective on the underlying neuronal process and offer new ways of inferring changes in local neuronal activity and effective connectivity from fMRI.},

Network-target stimulation differs from the dominant framework for TMS experiments, in which stimulation has been considered as a focal virtual lesion. We offer a conceptual framework for important distinctions between network-wide and focal effects of stimulation on episodic memory and discuss factors that may influence the quality and quantity of stimulation effects.

   abstract = {This target article is concerned with the implications of the surprisingly different experimental practices in economics and in areas of psychology relevant to both economists and psychologists, such as behavioral decision making. We consider four features of experimentation in economics, namely, script enactment, repeated trials, performance-based monetary payments, and the proscription against deception, and compare them to experimental practices in psychology, primarily in the area of behavioral decision making. Whereas economists bring a precisely defined “script” to experiments for participants to enact, psychologists often do not provide such a script, leaving participants to infer what choices the situation affords. By often using repeated experimental trials, economists allow participants to learn about the task and the environment; psychologists typically do not. Economists generally pay participants on the basis of clearly defined performance criteria; psychologists usually pay a flat fee or grant a fixed amount of course credit. Economists virtually never deceive participants; psychologists, especially in some areas of inquiry, often do. We argue that experimental standards in economics are regulatory in that they allow for little variation between the experimental practices of individual researchers. The experimental standards in psychology, by contrast, are comparatively laissez-faire. We believe that the wider range of experimental practices in psychology reflects a lack of procedural regularity that may contribute to the variability of empirical findings in the research fields under consideration. We conclude with a call for more research on the consequences of methodological preferences, such as the use on monetary payments, and propose a “do-it-both-ways” rule regarding the enactment of scripts, repetition of trials, and performance-based monetary payments. We also argue, on pragmatic grounds, that the default practice should be not to deceive participants.},

Accordingly, we predicted that classification learning would produce a deficit in people’s ability to draw novel contrasts— distinctions that were not part of training— compared with feature inference learning. Two experiments confirmed that classification learners were at a disadvantage at making novel distinctions. Eye movement data indicated that this conceptual inflexibility was due to (a) a narrower attention profile that reduces the encoding of many category features and (b) learned inattention that inhibits the reallocation of attention to newly relevant information.

   abstract = {Semantic cognition requires conceptual representations shaped by verbal and nonverbal experience and executive control processes that regulate activation of knowledge to meet current situational demands. A complete model must also account for the representation of concrete and abstract words, of taxonomic and associative relationships, and for the role of context in shaping meaning. We present the first major attempt to assimilate all of these elements within a unified, implemented computational framework. Our model combines a hub-and-spoke architecture with a buffer that allows its state to be influenced by prior context. This hybrid structure integrates the view, from cognitive neuroscience, that concepts are grounded in sensory-motor representation with the view, from computational linguistics, that knowledge is shaped by patterns of lexical co-occurrence. The model successfully codes knowledge for abstract and concrete words, associative and taxonomic relationships, and the multiple meanings of homonyms, within a single representational space. Knowledge of abstract words is acquired through (a) their patterns of co-occurrence with other words and (b) acquired embodiment, whereby they become indirectly associated with the perceptual features of co-occurring concrete words. The model accounts for executive influences on semantics by including a controlled retrieval mechanism that provides top-down input to amplify weak semantic relationships. The representational and control elements of the model can be damaged independently, and the consequences of such damage closely replicate effects seen in neuropsychological patients with loss of semantic representation versus control processes. Thus, the model provides a wide-ranging and neurally plausible account of normal and impaired semantic cognition.},

   abstract = {Sensory preconditioning protocols can be used to assess how the brain integrates memories that share common features. In these protocols, animals are first exposed to pairings of two relatively innocuous stimuli, S2 and S1 (stage 1), and then to pairings of one of these stimuli, S1, with an event of motivational significance (stage 2). Following this training, test presentations of S2 elicit responses appropriate to the motivationally significant event, and these responses are taken to indicate formation of distinct S2-S1 and S1-event memories that are integrated in some way to generate that responding. This paper reviews studies of sensory preconditioning in rats, mice, rabbits and people to determine whether S2-S1 and S1-event memories are integrated through a chaining process at the time of their retrieval (i.e., test presentations of S2 trigger retrieval of S1, and thereby, responses appropriate to the event); or "online" at the time of memory formation (i.e., in stage 2, S1 activates a representation of S2 such that both stimuli associate with the motivationally significant event). It finds that the type of integration is determined by the manner in which stimuli are presented in preconditioning as well as their familiarity. When the stimuli in preconditioning are presented repeatedly and/or serially (i.e., one after the other), the S2-S1 and S1-event memories are chained at the time of retrieval/testing. In contrast, when the stimuli in preconditioning are relatively novel and/or presented simultaneously, the S2-S1 and S1-event memories are integrated online. These statements are related to prior claims regarding the circumstances that promote different types of memory integration and, more generally, mechanisms of information processing in the mammalian brain.},

   abstract = {Working memory (WM) plays an important role in action planning and decision making; however, both the informational content of memory and how that information is used in decisions remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we used a color WM task in which subjects viewed colored stimuli and reported both an estimate of a stimulus color and a measure of memory uncertainty, obtained through a rewarded decision. Reported memory uncertainty is correlated with memory error, showing that people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory quality into rewarded decisions. Moreover, memory uncertainty can be combined with other sources of information; after inducing expectations (prior beliefs) about stimuli probabilities, we found that estimates became shifted toward expected colors, with the shift increasing with reported uncertainty. The data are best fit by models in which people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory uncertainty with potential rewards and prior beliefs. Our results suggest that WM represents uncertainty information, and that this can be combined with prior beliefs. This highlights the potential complexity of WM representations and shows that rewarded decision can be a powerful tool for examining WM and informing and constraining theoretical, computational, and neurobiological models of memory.},

While the predictive power of these networks is high, it is often not clear whether they also offer useful explanations of the task at hand. Convolutional neural network representations have been shown to be predictive of human similarity judgments for images after appropriate adaptation. However, these high-dimensional representations are difﬁcult to interpret. Here we present a method for reducing these representations to a low-dimensional space which is still predictive of similarity judgments. We show that these lowdimensional representations also provide insightful explanations of factors underlying human similarity judgments.},

   abstract = {Computational and learning theory models propose that behavioral control reflects value that is both cached (computed and stored during previous experience) and inferred (estimated on the fly on the basis of knowledge of the causal structure of the environment). The latter is thought to depend on the orbitofrontal cortex. Yet some accounts propose that the orbitofrontal cortex contributes to behavior by signaling "economic" value, regardless of the associative basis of the information. We found that the orbitofrontal cortex is critical for both value-based behavior and learning when value must be inferred but not when a cached value is sufficient. The orbitofrontal cortex is thus fundamental for accessing model-based representations of the environment to compute value rather than for signaling value per se.},

   pages = {628-666},
   abstract = {Binary choice tasks, such as 2-alternative forced choice, show a complex yet consistent pattern of sequential effects, whereby responses and response times depend on the detailed pattern of prior stimuli going back at least 5 trials. We show this pattern is well explained by simultaneous incremental learning of 2 simple statistics of the trial sequence: the base rate and the repetition rate. Both statistics are learned by the same basic associative mechanism, but they contribute different patterns of sequential effects because they entail different representations of the trial sequence. Subtler aspects of the data that are not explained by these 2 learning processes alone are explained by their interaction, via learning from joint error correction. Specifically, the cue-competition mechanism that has explained classic findings in animal learning (e.g., blocking) appears to operate on learning of sequence statistics. We also find that learning of the base rate and repetition rate are dissociated into response and stimulus processing, respectively, as indicated by event-related potentials, manipulations of stimulus discriminability, and reanalysis of past experiments that eliminated stimuli or prior responses. Thus, sequential effects in these tasks appear to be driven by learning the response base rate and the stimulus repetition rate. Connections are discussed between these findings and previous research attempting to separate stimulus- and response-based sequential effects, and research using sequential effects to determine mental representations. We conclude that sequential effects offer a powerful means for uncovering representations and learning mechanisms.},

   pages = {1-32},
   abstract = {Much current research on speeded choice utilizes models in which the response is triggered by a stochastic process crossing a deterministic threshold. This article focuses on 2 such model classes, 1 based on continuous-time diffusion and the other on linear ballistic accumulation (LBA). Both models assume random variability in growth rates and in other model components across trials. We show that if the form of this variability is unconstrained, the models can exactly match any possible pattern of response probabilities and response time distributions. Thus, the explanatory or predictive content of these models is determined not by their structural assumptions but, rather, by distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian distributions) that are traditionally regarded as implementation details. Selective influence assumptions (i.e., which experimental manipulations affect which model parameters) are shown to have no restrictive effect, except for the theoretically questionable assumption that speed–accuracy instructions do not affect growth rates. The 2nd contribution of this article concerns translation of falsifiable models between universal modeling languages. Specifically, we translate the predictions of the diffusion and LBA models (with their parametric and selective influence assumptions intact) into the Grice modeling framework, in which accumulation processes are deterministic and thresholds are random variables. The Grice framework is also known to reproduce any possible pattern of response probabilities and times, and hence it can be used as a common language for comparing models. It is found that only a few simple properties of empirical data are necessary predictions of the diffusion and LBA models.},

   volume = {19},
   number = {1},
   pages = {25},
   abstract = {Background:  Numerous studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of passive and active deviance and target detection in the well-known auditory oddball paradigm by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present auditory oddball study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of passive versus active deviance and target detection by analyzing amplitude modulations of early and late ERPs while at the same time exploring the neural sources underling this modulation with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Methods:  A 64-channel EEG was recorded from twelve healthy right-handed participants while listening to ‘standards’ and ‘deviants’ (500 vs. 1000 Hz pure tones) during a passive (block 1) and an active (block 2) listening condition. During passive listening, participants had to simply listen to the tones. During active listening they had to attend and press a key in response to the deviant tones. Results:  Passive and active listening elicited an N1 component, a mismatch negativity (MMN) as difference potential (whose amplitudes were temporally overlapping with the N1) and a P3 component. N1/MMN and P3 amplitudes were significantly more pronounced for deviants as compared to standards during both listening conditions. Active listening augmented P3 modulation to deviants significantly compared to passive listening, whereas deviance detection as indexed by N1/MMN modulation was unaffected by the task. During passive listening, sLORETA contrasts (deviants > standards) revealed significant activations in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the lingual gyri bilaterally (N1/MMN) as well as in the left and right insulae (P3). During active listening, significant activations were found for the N1/MMN in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and for the P3 in multiple cortical regions (e.g., precuneus). Discussion:  The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that passive as well as active deviance and target detection elicit cortical activations in spatially distributed brain regions and neural networks including the ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and salience network (SN). Based on the temporal activation of the neural sources underlying ERP modulations, a neurophysiological model of passive and active deviance and target detection is proposed which can be tested in future studies.},

   abstract = {Information about potential rewards in the environment is essential for guiding adaptive behavior, and understanding neural reward processes may provide insights into neuropsychiatric dysfunctions. Over the past 10 years, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques have been used to study brain areas encoding information about expected and experienced outcomes. These studies have identiﬁed reward signals throughout the brain, including the striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. This review article discusses some of the assumptions and models that are used to interpret results from these studies, and how they relate to ﬁndings from animal electrophysiology. The article reviews and summarizes some of the key ﬁndings from MVPA studies on reward. In particular, it ﬁrst focuses on studies that, in addition to mapping out the brain areas that process rewards, have provided novel insights into the coding mechanisms of value and reward. Then, it discusses examples of how multivariate imaging approaches are being used more recently to decode features of expected rewards that go beyond value, such as the identity of an expected outcome or the action required to obtain it. The study of such complex and multifaceted reward representations highlights the key advantage of using representational methods, which are uniquely able to reveal these signals and may narrow the gap between animal and human research. Applied in a clinical context, MVPA may advance our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders and the development of novel treatment strategies.},

   abstract = {Compulsive behaviors are central to addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder and can be understood as a failure of adaptive decision making. Particularly, they can be conceptualized as an imbalance in behavioral control, such that behavior is guided predominantly by learned rather than inferred outcome expectations. Inference is a computational process required for adaptive behavior, and recent work across species has identified the neural circuitry that supports inference-based decision making. This includes the orbitofrontal cortex, which has long been implicated in disorders of compulsive behavior. Inspired by evidence that modulating orbitofrontal cortex activity can alter inference-based behaviors, here we discuss noninvasive approaches to target these circuits in humans. Specifically, we discuss the potential of network-targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation and real-time neurofeedback to modulate the neural underpinnings of inference. Both interventions leverage recent advances in our understanding of the neurocomputational mechanisms of inference-based behavior and may be used to complement current treatment approaches for behavioral disorders.},

   pages = {709-715},
   abstract = {In everyday life, successful decision making requires precise representations of expected values. However, for most behavioral options more than one attribute can be relevant in order to predict the expected reward. Thus, to make good or even optimal choices the reward predictions of multiple attributes need to be integrated into a combined expected value. Importantly, the individual attributes of such multi-attribute objects can agree or disagree in their reward prediction. Here we address where the brain encodes the combined reward prediction (averaged across attributes) and where it encodes the variability of the value predictions of the individual attributes. We acquired fMRI data while subjects performed a task in which they had to integrate reward predictions from multiple attributes into a combined value. Using time-resolved pattern recognition techniques (support vector regression) we ﬁnd that (1) the combined value is encoded in distributed fMRI patterns in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and that (2) the variability of value predictions of the individual attributes is encoded in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The combined value could be used to guide choices, whereas the variability of the value predictions of individual attributes indicates an ambiguity that results in an increased difﬁculty of the value-integration. These results demonstrate that the different features deﬁning multi-attribute objects are encoded in non-overlapping brain regions and therefore suggest different roles for vmPFC and dlPFC in multi-attribute decision making. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Despite the recognition that the surface Laplacian may counteract adverse effects of volume conduction and recording reference for surface potential data, electrophysiology as a discipline has been reluctant to embrace this approach for data analysis. The reasons for such hesitation are manifold but often involve unfamiliarity with the nature of the underlying transformation, as well as intimidation by a perceived mathematical complexity, and concerns of signal loss, dense electrode array requirements, or susceptibility to noise. We revisit the pitfalls arising from volume conduction and the mandated arbitrary choice of EEG reference, describe the basic principle of the surface Laplacian transform in an intuitive fashion, and exemplify the differences between common reference schemes (nose, linked mastoids, average) and the surface Laplacian for frequently-measured EEG spectra (theta, alpha) and standard event-related potential (ERP) components, such as N1 or P3. We speciﬁcally review common reservations against the universal use of the surface Laplacian, which can be effectively addressed by employing spherical spline interpolations with an appropriate selection of the spline ﬂexibility parameter and regularization constant. We argue from a pragmatic perspective that not only are these reservations unfounded but that the continued predominant use of surface potentials poses a considerable impediment on the progress of EEG and ERP research.},

   abstract = {We present a review of dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) data. DCM is based on a spatiotemporal model, where the temporal component is formulated in terms of neurobiologically plausible dynamics. Following an intuitive description of the model, we discuss six recent studies, which use DCM to analyze M/EEG and local ﬁeld potentials. These studies illustrate how DCM can be used to analyze evoked responses (average response in time), induced responses (average response in time-frequency), and steady-state responses (average response in frequency). Bayesian model comparison plays a critical role in these analyses, by allowing one to compare equally plausible models in terms of their model evidence. This approach might be very useful in M/EEG research; where correlations among spatial and neuronal model parameter estimates can cause uncertainty about which model best explains the data. Bayesian model comparison resolves these uncertainties in a principled and formal way. We suggest that DCM and Bayesian model comparison provides a useful way to test hypotheses about distributed processing in the brain, using electromagnetic data. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1866–1876, 2009.

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to provide the ﬁrst, comprehensive meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature regarding greater neural responses to a deviant stimulus in a stream of repeated, standard stimuli, termed here oddball effects. The meta-analysis of 75 independent studies included a comparison of auditory and visual oddball effects and task-relevant and task-irrelevant oddball effects. The results were interpreted with reference to the model in which a large-scale dorsal frontoparietal network embodies a mechanism for orienting attention to the environment, whereas a large-scale ventral frontoparietal network supports the detection of salient, environmental changes. The meta-analysis yielded three main sets of ﬁndings. First, ventral network regions were strongly associated with oddball effects and largely common to auditory and visual modalities, indicating a supramodal “alerting” system. Most ventral network components were more strongly associated with task-relevant than taskirrelevant oddball effects, indicating a dynamic interplay of stimulus saliency and internal goals in stimulus-driven engagement of the network. Second, the bilateral inferior frontal junction, an anterior core of the dorsal network, was strongly associated with oddball effects, suggesting a central role in top-down attentional control. However, other dorsal network regions showed no or only modest association with oddball effects, likely reﬂecting active engagement during both oddball and standard stimulus processing. Finally, prominent oddball effects outside the two networks included the sensory cortex regions, likely reﬂecting attentive and preattentive modulation of early sensory activity, and subcortical regions involving the putamen, thalamus, and other areas, likely reﬂecting subcortical involvement in alerting responses.

   abstract = {We compared the sensitivity of standard single-shot 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) to three advanced EPI sequences, i.e., 2D multi-echo EPI, 3D high resolution EPI and 3D dual-echo fast EPI in fixed effect and random effects group level fMRI analyses at 3T. The study focused on how well the variance reduction in fixed effect analyses achieved by advanced EPI sequences translates into increased sensitivity in the random effects group level analysis. The sensitivity was estimated in a functional MRI experiment of an emotional learning and a reward based learning tasks in a group of 24 volunteers. Each experiment was acquired with the four different sequences. The task-related response amplitude, contrast level and respective t-value were proxies for the functional sensitivity across the brain. All three advanced EPI methods increased the sensitivity in the fixed effects analyses, but standard single-shot 2D EPI provided a comparable performance in random effects group analysis when whole brain coverage and moderate resolution are required. In this experiment inter-subject variability determined the sensitivity of the random effects analysis for most brain regions, making the impact of EPI pulse sequence improvements less relevant or even negligible for random effects analyses. An exception concerns the optimization of EPI reducing susceptibility-related signal loss that translates into an enhanced sensitivity e.g. in the orbitofrontal cortex for multi-echo EPI. Thus, future optimization strategies may best aim at reducing inter-subject variability for higher sensitivity in standard fMRI group studies at moderate spatial resolution.},

   abstract = {A dominant focus in studies of learning and decision-making is the neural coding of scalar reward value. This emphasis ignores the fact that choices are strongly shaped by a rich representation of potential rewards. Here, using fMRI adaptation, we demonstrate that responses in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode a representation of the specific type of food reward predicted by a visual cue. By controlling for value across rewards and by linking each reward with two distinct stimuli, we could test for representations of reward-identity that were independent of associative information. Our results show reward-identity representations in a medial-caudal region of OFC, independent of the associated predictive stimulus. This contrasts with a more rostro-lateral OFC region encoding reward-identity representations tied to the predicate stimulus. This demonstration of adaptation in OFC to reward specific representations opens an avenue for investigation of more complex decision mechanisms that are not immediately accessible in standard analyses, which focus on correlates of average activity.},

The authors specifically focused on category density— or the proportion of category-relevant variance to the total variance. Results of Experiments 1–3 showed a clear dissociation between dense and sparse categories: Whereas dense categories were readily learned without supervision, learning of sparse categories required supervision. There were also developmental differences in how statistical density affected category representation. Although children represented both dense and sparse categories on the basis of the overall similarity (Experiment 4A), adults represented dense categories on the basis of similarity and represented sparse categories on the basis of the inclusion rule (Experiment 4B). The results support the notion that statistical structure interacts with the learning regime in their effects on category learning. In addition, these results elucidate important developmental differences in how categories are represented, which presents interesting challenges for theories of categorization.},

   abstract = {Research on risky and intertemporal decision-making often focuses on descriptive models of choice. This class of models sometimes lack a psychological process account of how different cognitive processes give rise to choice behavior. Here, we attempt to decompose these processes using sequential accumulator modeling (i.e., the linear ballistic accumulator model). Participants were presented with pairs of gambles that either involve different levels of probability or delay (Experiment 1) or a combination of these dimensions (both probability and delay; Experiment 2). Response times were recorded as a measure of preferential strength. We then combined choice data and response times, and utilized variants of the linear ballistic accumulator to explore different assumptions about how preferences are formed. Speciﬁcally, we show that a model that allows for the subjective evaluation of a ﬁxed now/certain option to change as a function of the delayed/risky option with which it is paired provides the best account of the combined choice and response time (RT) data. The work highlights the advantages of using cognitive process models in risky and intertemporal choice, and points toward a common framework for understanding how people evaluate time and probability.},

   abstract = {Behavioral and economic theories have long maintained that actions are chosen so as to minimize demands for exertion or work, a principle sometimes referred to as the law of less work. The data supporting this idea pertain almost entirely to demands for physical effort. However, the same minimization principle has often been assumed also to apply to cognitive demand. The authors set out to evaluate the validity of this assumption. In 6 behavioral experiments, participants chose freely between courses of action associated with different levels of demand for controlled information processing. Together, the results of these experiments revealed a bias in favor of the less demanding course of action. The bias was obtained across a range of choice settings and demand manipulations and was not wholly attributable to strategic avoidance of errors, minimization of time on task, or maximization of the rate of goal achievement. It is remarkable that the effect also did not depend on awareness of the demand manipulation. Consistent with a motivational account, avoidance of demand displayed sensitivity to task incentives and covaried with individual differences in the efficacy of executive control.

   title = {Representational similarity analysis – connecting the branches of systems neuroscience},
   journal = {Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience},
   abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to deﬁne the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities.The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more uniﬁed systems neuroscience.},

However, these sequences have only been studied in the context of spatial tasks and never in humans. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) while human subjects performed a novel non-spatial reasoning task. The task required selecting paths through a set of six visual objects. We trained pattern classiﬁers on the MEG activity elicited by direct presentation of the visual objects alone and tested these classiﬁers on activity recorded during periods when no object was presented. During these object-free periods, the brain spontaneously visited representations of approximately four objects in fast sequences lasting on the order of 120 ms. These sequences followed backward trajectories along the permissible paths in the task. Thus, spontaneous fast sequential representation of states can be measured non-invasively in humans, and these sequences may be a fundamental feature of neural computation across tasks.},

   abstract = {Background: Spatial and temporal resolution of brain network activity can be improved by combining different modalities. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides full brain coverage with limited temporal resolution, while electroencephalography (EEG), estimates cortical activity with high temporal resolution. Combining them may provide improved network characterization. New Method: We examined relationships between EEG spatiospectral pattern timecourses and concurrent fMRI BOLD signals using canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) with its 1st and 2nd temporal derivatives in voxel-wise general linear models (GLM). HRF shapes were derived from EEG-fMRI time courses during “restingstate”, visual oddball and semantic decision paradigms. Results: The resulting GLM F-maps self-organized into several different large-scale brain networks (LSBNs) often with different timing between EEG and fMRI revealed through differences in GLM-derived HRF shapes (e.g., with a lower time to peak than the canonical HRF). We demonstrate that some EEG spatiospectral patterns (related to concurrent fMRI) are weakly task-modulated. Comparison with existing method(s): Previously, we demonstrated 14 independent EEG spatiospectral patterns within this EEG dataset, stable across the resting-state, visual oddball and semantic decision paradigms. Here, we demonstrate that their time courses are significantly correlated with fMRI dynamics organized into LSBN structures. EEG-fMRI derived HRF peak appears earlier than the canonical HRF peak, which suggests limitations when assuming a canonical HRF shape in EEG-fMRI. Conclusions: This is the first study examining EEG-fMRI relationships among independent EEG spatiospectral patterns over different paradigms. The findings highlight the importance of considering different HRF shapes when spatiotemporally characterizing brain networks using EEG and fMRI.},

   abstract = {The latest generation of neural networks has made major performance advances in object categorization from raw images. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks currently outperform alternative approaches on standard benchmarks by wide margins and achieve human-like accuracy on some tasks. These engineering successes present an opportunity to explore long-standing questions about the nature of human concepts by putting psychological theories to test at an unprecedented scale. This paper evaluates deep convolutional networks trained for classiﬁcation on their ability to predict category typicality – a variable of paramount importance in the psychology of concepts – from the raw pixels of naturalistic images of objects. We ﬁnd that these models have substantial predictive power, unlike simpler features computed from the same massive dataset, showing how typicality might emerge as a byproduct of a complex model trained to maximize classiﬁcation performance.},

   abstract = {Working memory (WM) capacity limitations and their neurophysiological correlates are of special relevance for the understanding of higher cognitive functions. Evidence from behavioral studies suggests that restricted attentional resources contribute to these capacity limitations. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we probed the capacity of the human visual WM system for up to four complex nonnatural objects using a delayed discrimination task. A number of prefrontal and parietal areas bilaterally showed increased blood oxygen level-dependent activity, relative to baseline, throughout the task when more than one object had to be held in memory. Monotonic increases in response to memory load were observed bilaterally in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Conversely, activity in the frontal eye ﬁelds (FEFs) and in areas along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) peaked when subjects had to maintain only two or three objects and decreased in the highest load condition. This dissociation of memory load effects on cortical activity suggests that the cognitive operations subserved by the IPS and FEF, which are most likely related to attention, fail to support visual WM when the capacity limit is approached. The correlation of brain activity with performance implies that only the operations performed by the DLPFC and pre-SMA, which support an integrated representation of visual information, helped subjects to maintain a reasonable level of performance in the highest load condition. These results indicate that at least two distinct cortical subsystems are recruited for visual WM, and that their interplay changes when the capacity limit is reached.},

   abstract = {Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspeciﬁcation and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difﬁcult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientiﬁc studies.},

   abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.},

   abstract = {Judging a person as a friend or foe, a mushroom as edible or poisonous, or a sound as an l or r are examples of categorization problems. This chapter considers the relative merits of four basic types of category learning models: rule-, prototype-, exemplar-, and clusterbased models. The history of model progression is marked by descendant models displaying increasingly sophisticated processing mechanisms that can manifest the behaviors of ancestral models. These four basic model types are related to the computations performed by four candidate learning systems in the human brain, which rely on prefrontal cortex, posterior occipital cortex, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobes. One issue raised is whether the prefrontal cortex and posterior occipital cortex support true learning systems or are better viewed as supporting general cognitive and perceptual abilities. Use of well-specified cognitive models can help answer related theoretical questions, such as how multiple learning systems contribute to categorization behavior.},

Experiments 1 and 2 extend this work by considering unsupervised learning modes. Acquisition patterns displayed by the subjects in supervised classification learning did not extend to unsupervised learning tasks. In particular, an advantage of linear category structures over nonlinear category structures was displayed in the unsupervised learning studies ( particularly when the subjects were engaged in incidental unsupervised learning).},

   abstract = {Every scientist chooses a preferred level of analysis and this choice shapes the research program, even determining what counts as evidence. This contribution revisits Marr’s (1982) three levels of analysis (implementation, algorithmic, and computational) and evaluates the prospect of making progress at each individual level. After reviewing limitations of theorizing within a level, two strategies for integration across levels are considered. One is top–down in that it attempts to build a bridge from the computational to algorithmic level. Limitations of this approach include insufﬁcient theoretical constraint at the computation level to provide a foundation for integration, and that people are suboptimal for reasons other than capacity limitations. Instead, an inside-out approach is forwarded in which all three levels of analysis are integrated via the algorithmic level. This approach maximally leverages mutual data constraints at all levels. For example, algorithmic models can be used to interpret brain imaging data, and brain imaging data can be used to select among competing models. Examples of this approach to integration are provided. This merging of levels raises questions about the relevance of Marr’s tripartite view.},

   abstract = {Cocaine addiction is a complex and multidimensional process involving a number of behavioral and neural forms of plasticity. The behavioral transition from voluntary drug use to compulsive drug taking may be explained at the neural level by drug-induced changes in function or interaction between a flexible planning system, associated with prefrontal cortical regions, and a rigid habit system, associated with the striatum. The dichotomy between these two systems is operationalized in computational theory by positing model-based and model-free learning mechanisms, the former relying on an "internal model" of the environment and the latter on pre-computed or cached values to control behavior. In this review, we will suggest that model-free and model-based learning mechanisms appear to be differentially affected, at least in the case of psychostimulants such as cocaine, with the former being enhanced while the latter are disrupted. As a result, the behavior of long-term drug users becomes less flexible and responsive to the desirability of expected outcomes and more habitual, based on the long history of reinforcement. To support our specific proposal, we will review recent neural and behavioral evidence on the effect of psychostimulant exposure on orbitofrontal and dorsolateral striatum structure and function.

   abstract = {Addiction is characterized by a lack of insight into the likely outcomes of one's behavior. Insight, or the ability to imagine outcomes, is evident when outcomes have not been directly experienced. Using this concept, work in both rats and humans has recently identified neural correlates of insight in the medial and orbital prefrontal cortices. We found that these correlates were selectively abolished in rats by cocaine self-administration. Their abolition was associated with behavioral deficits and reduced synaptic efficacy in orbitofrontal cortex, the reversal of which by optogenetic activation restored normal behavior. These results provide a link between cocaine use and problems with insight. Deficits in these functions are likely to be particularly important for problems such as drug relapse, in which behavior fails to account for likely adverse outcomes. As such, our data provide a neural target for therapeutic approaches to address these defining long-term effects of drug use.},

   abstract = {Risky intertemporal choices involve choosing between options that can differ in outcomes, their probability of receipt, and the delay until receipt. To date, there has been no attempt to systematically test, compare, and evaluate theoretical models of such choices. We contribute to theory development by generating predictions from 7 models for 3 common manipulations—magnitude, certainty, and immediacy—across 6 different types of risky intertemporal choices. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of model predictions to data from an experiment involving almost 4,000 individual choices revealed that an attribute comparison-model, newly modified to incorporate risky intertemporal choices, (the risky intertemporal choice heuristic or RITCH) provided the best account of the data. Results are consistent with growing evidence in support of attribute comparison models in the risky and intertemporal choice literatures, and suggest that the relatively poorer fits of translation-based models reflect their inability to predict the differential impact of certainty and immediacy manipulations. Future theories of risky intertemporal choice may benefit from treating risk and time as independent dimensions, and focusing on attribute-comparison rather than value-comparison processes.},

   abstract = {Across the social sciences, researchers have overwhelmingly used the classical statistical paradigm to draw conclusions from data, often focusing heavily on a single number: p. Recent years, however, have witnessed a surge of interest in an alternative statistical paradigm: Bayesian inference, in which probabilities are attached to parameters and models. We feel it is informative to provide statistical conclusions that go beyond a single number, and –regardless of one’s statistical preference– it can be prudent to report the results from both the classical and the Bayesian paradigm. In order to promote a more inclusive and insightful approach to statistical inference we show how the open-source software program JASP (jasp-stats.org) provides a set of comprehensive Bayesian reanalyses from just a few commonly-reported summary statistics such as t and N . These Bayesian reanalyses allow researchers –and also editors, reviewers, readers, and reporters– to quantify evidence on a continuous scale, assess the robustness of that evidence to changes in the prior distribution, and gauge which posterior parameter ranges are more credible than others. The procedure is illustrated using the seminal Festinger and Carlsmith (1959) study on cognitive dissonance.},

   abstract = {Concepts organize the relationship among individual stimuli or events by highlighting shared features. Often, new goals require updating conceptual knowledge to reflect relationships based on different goal-relevant features. Here, our aim is to determine how hippocampal (HPC) object representations are organized and updated to reflect changing conceptual knowledge. Participants learned two classification tasks in which successful learning required attention to different stimulus features, thus providing a means to index how representations of individual stimuli are reorganized according to changing task goals. We used a computational learning model to capture how people attended to goal-relevant features and organized object representations based on those features during learning. Using representational similarity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we demonstrate that neural representations in left anterior HPC correspond with model predictions of concept organization. Moreover, we show that during early learning, when concept updating is most consequential, HPC is functionally coupled with prefrontal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that when task goals change, object representations in HPC can be organized in new ways, resulting in updated concepts that highlight the features most critical to the new goal.},

Here, we propose the Episodes-to-Concepts (EpCon) theoretical model of hippocampal function in concept learning and review evidence for the hippocampal computations that support concept formation including memory integration, attentional biasing, and memory-based prediction error. We focus on recent studies that have directly assessed the hippocampal role in concept learning with an innovative approach that combines computational modeling and sophisticated neuroimaging measures. Collectively, this work suggests that the hippocampus does much more than encode individual episodes; rather, it adaptively transforms initially-encoded episodic memories into organized conceptual knowledge that drives novel behavior.},

To this end, participants played an UG against fair and unfair opponents, where they had to accept or reject (fair and unfair) monetary offers, and then received a cTBS prior to playing a DG against the same opponents with reversed roles. The participants now had the possibility to forgive the unfair opponents (allocation of a fair amount of money) or to take revenge whereby the cTBS effects were assessed with functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Following verum cTBS, participants allocated significantly less money to their unfair opponents than in the placebo cTBS condition. Also, reaction times (RTs) differed significantly between verum and placebo cTBS for unfair opponents (higher RTs following verum stimulation) but not for fair opponents. These results strongly indicate that cognitive control is a fundamental requirement for overcoming unwanted emotional responses.},

   abstract = {People can test hypotheses through either selection or reception. In a selection task, the learner actively chooses observations to test his or her beliefs, whereas in reception tasks data are passively encountered. People routinely use both forms of testing in everyday life, but the critical psychological differences between selection and reception learning remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that selection learning improves learning performance by enhancing generic cognitive processes related to motivation, attention, and engagement. Alternatively, we suggest that differences between these 2 learning modes derives from a hypothesis-dependent sampling bias that is introduced when a person collects data to test his or her own individual hypothesis. Drawing on influential models of sequential hypothesis-testing behavior, we show that such a bias (a) can lead to the collection of data that facilitates learning compared with reception learning and (b) can be more effective than observing the selections of another person. We then report a novel experiment based on a popular category learning paradigm that compares reception and selection learning. We additionally compare selection learners to a set of “yoked” participants who viewed the exact same sequence of observations under reception conditions. The results revealed systematic differences in performance that depended on the learner’s role in collecting information and the abstract structure of the problem.},

   abstract = {When a person fails to obtain an expected reward from an object in the environment, they face a credit assignment problem: Did the absence of reward reflect an extrinsic property of the environment or an intrinsic error in motor execution? To explore this problem, we modified a popular decision-making task used in studies of reinforcement learning, the two-armed bandit task. We compared a version in which choices were indicated by key presses, the standard response in such tasks, to a version in which the choices were indicated by reaching movements, which affords execution failures. In the key press condition, participants exhibited a strong risk aversion bias; strikingly, this bias reversed in the reaching condition. This result can be explained by a reinforcement model wherein movement errors influence decision-making, either by gating reward prediction errors or by modifying an implicit representation of motor competence. Two further experiments support the gating hypothesis. First, we used a condition in which we provided visual cues indicative of movement errors but informed the participants that trial outcomes were independent of their actual movements. The main result was replicated, indicating that the gating process is independent of participants’ explicit sense of control. Second, individuals with cerebellar degeneration failed to modulate their behavior between the key press and reach conditions, providing converging evidence of an implicit influence of movement error signals on reinforcement learning. These results provide a mechanistically tractable solution to the credit assignment problem.},

   abstract = {Generalization is a fundamental aspect of behavior, allowing for the transfer of knowledge from one context to another. The details of this transfer are thought to reveal how the brain represents what it learns. Generalization has been a central focus in studies of sensorimotor adaptation, and its pattern has been well characterized: Learning of new dynamic and kinematic transformations in one region of space tapers off in a Gaussian-like fashion to neighboring untrained regions, echoing tuned population codes in the brain. In contrast to common allusions to generalization in cognitive science, generalization in visually guided reaching is usually framed as a passive consequence of neural tuning functions rather than a cognitive feature of learning. While previous research has presumed that maximum generalization occurs at the instructed task goal or the actual movement direction, recent work suggests that maximum generalization may occur at the location of an explicitly accessible movement plan. Here we provide further support for plan-based generalization, formalize this theory in an updated model of adaptation, and test several unexpected implications of the model. First, we employ a generalization paradigm to parameterize the generalization function and ascertain its maximum point. We then apply the derived generalization function to our model and successfully simulate and fit the time course of implicit adaptation across three behavioral experiments. We find that dynamics predicted by plan-based generalization are borne out in the data, are contrary to what traditional models predict, and lead to surprising implications for the behavioral, computational, and neural characteristics of sensorimotor adaptation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The pattern of generalization is thought to reveal how the motor system represents learned actions. Recent work has made the intriguing suggestion that maximum generalization in sensorimotor adaptation tasks occurs at the location of the learned movement plan. Here we support this interpretation, develop a novel model of motor adaptation that incorporates plan-based generalization, and use the model to successfully predict surprising dynamics in the time course of adaptation across several conditions.},

   abstract = {Decisions must be implemented through actions, and actions are prone to error. As such, when an expected outcome is not obtained, an individual should be sensitive to not only whether the choice itself was suboptimal but also whether the action required to indicate that choice was executed successfully. The intelligent assignment of credit to action execution versus action selection has clear ecological utility for the learner. To explore this, we used a modiﬁed version of a classic reinforcement learning task in which feedback indicated whether negative prediction errors were, or were not, associated with execution errors. Using fMRI, we asked if prediction error computations in the human striatum, a key substrate in reinforcement learning and decision making, are modulated when a failure in action execution results in the negative outcome. Participants were more tolerant of non-rewarded outcomes when these resulted from execution errors versus when execution was successful, but reward was withheld. Consistent with this behavior, a model-driven analysis of neural activity revealed an attenuation of the signal associated with negative reward prediction errors in the striatum following execution failures. These results converge with other lines of evidence suggesting that prediction errors in the mesostriatal dopamine system integrate high-level information during the evaluation of instantaneous reward outcomes.},

Various models of decision-making have focused on perceptual evidence, past experience, and task complexity as important factors determining the degree of deliberation needed for a decision. Here, we build on a sequential sampling decision-making framework to develop a new model that captures a range of reaction time (RT) effects by accounting for both working memory and instrumental learning processes. The model captures choices and RTs at various stages of learning, and in learning environments with varying complexity. Moreover, the model generalizes from tasks with deterministic reward contingencies to probabilistic ones. The model succeeds in part by incorporating prior uncertainty over actions when modeling RT. This straightforward process model provides a parsimonious account of decision dynamics during instrumental learning and makes unique predictions about internal representations of action values.},

Although previous studies have reported activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) correlating with the value of different goal stimuli, it remains unclear whether such goal-value representations are independent of the associated stimulus categorization, as required by a common currency. Using multivoxel pattern analyses on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we found a region of medial prefrontal cortex to contain a distributed goal-value code that is independent of stimulus category. More ventrally in the vmPFC, we found spatially distinct areas of the medial orbitofrontal cortex to contain unique category-dependent distributed value codes for food and consumer items. These results implicate the medial prefrontal cortex in the implementation of a common currency and suggest a ventral versus dorsal topographical organization of value signals in the vmPFC.},

   abstract = {Stereotype formation about novel groups was analyzed with trivariate stimulus distributions that were generated by group membership, valence of behavior, and a context variable. Within this stimulus setting, we manipulated the confounding role of the context variable and the distinctiveness of events in terms of their relative infrequency. The experimental procedure allowed us to analyze illusory and spurious correlations in a joint framework, to conduct focused tests for memory effects of relative infrequency and to investigate the detection of covariations with the context variable. The results revealed that illusory and spurious correlations were formed without enhanced memory for infrequent events and with existing covariations of the confounding context factor being well extracted. These observations suggest that illusory and spurious correlations can be understood without assuming speciﬁc cognitive processes that are tied to the particular characteristics of a given stimulus distribution, such as enhanced memory in the case of relative infrequency and neglect of a context variable in the case of a confounding factor. Instead, computer simulations with an exemplar-based learning model demonstrated that exemplar-based category learning may provide a coherent and integrative theoretical framework for illusory correlations, spurious correlations and true contingency learning in social cognition.

   abstract = {The Leaky Competitive Accumulator (LCA) model for perceptual discrimination is rapidly growing in popularity due to its neural plausibility. The model assumes that perceptual choices and associated response times are the consequence of the accrual of evidence for the various response alternatives up to a certain predetermined threshold. In addition, accrual of evidence is influenced by temporal leakage of information and mutual inhibition between the accumulators. In this paper we provide an overview of fitting routines that may be used to identify the parameter values used for generating data under the LCA assumptions. We find that because (a) there is no closed-form solution to the likelihood function of the LCA model, and (b) there are strong trade-offs between accumulation rate, leakage, and inhibition, it is extremely difficult to faithfully recover the parameters of the LCA model. To minimize these problems, we recommend to use DE-MCMC sampling, collect very large amounts of data, and constrain the parameter space where possible.},

   abstract = {1. We used single neuron recording techniques in two behaving monkeys to investigate the conditions in which dopamine neurons respond to primary rewarding or potentially rewarding stimuli. Animals received drops of liquid either outside behavioral tasks or as rewards during learning or established performance of an auditory reaction time task. 2. Three quarters of dopamine neurons showed a short-latency, phasic response to liquid that was delivered outside the task without being predicted by phasic stimuli. The same neurons responded to liquid reward during learning but not when task performance was established, at which time the neuronal response occurred to the conditioned, reward-predicting, movement-triggering stimulus. 3. These data suggest that the responses of dopamine neurons to rewarding or potentially rewarding liquid are due to the temporally unpredicted stimulus occurrence. A known, reward-predicting, tonic context does not prevent dopamine neurons from responding to the rewarding liquid. The responses during learning apparently occur because reward is not yet reliably predicted by a conditioned phasic stimulus. Because the unpredicted occurrence of reward is of central importance for learning, these responses allow dopamine neurons to play an important role in reward-driven learning.},

   abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is widely hypothesized to result from disordered communication across brain-wide networks. Yet, prior resting-state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies of MDD have studied zero-lag temporal synchrony (functional connectivity) in brain activity absent directional information. We utilize the recent discovery of stereotyped brain-wide directed signaling patterns in humans to investigate the relationship between directed rs-fMRI activity, MDD, and treatment response to FDA-approved neurostimulation paradigm termed Stanford neuromodulation therapy (SNT). We find that SNT over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) induces directed signaling shifts in the left DLPFC and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Directional signaling shifts in the ACC, but not the DLPFC, predict improvement in depression symptoms, and moreover, pretreatment ACC signaling predicts both depression severity and the likelihood of SNT treatment response. Taken together, our findings suggest that ACC-based directed signaling patterns in rs-fMRI are a potential biomarker of MDD.},

   abstract = {The discovery that spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals contain information about the functional organization of the brain has caused a paradigm shift in neuroimaging. It is now well established that intrinsic brain activity is organized into spatially segregated resting-state networks (RSNs). Less is known regarding how spatially segregated networks are integrated by the propagation of intrinsic activity over time. To explore this question, we examined the latency structure of spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI BOLD signal. Our data reveal that intrinsic activity propagates through and across networks on a timescale of approximately 1 s. Variations in the latency structure of this activity resulting from sensory state manipulation (eyes open vs. closed), antecedent motor task (button press) performance, and time of day (morning vs. evening) suggest that BOLD signal lags reflect neuronal processes rather than hemodynamic delay. Our results emphasize the importance of the temporal structure of the brain's spontaneous activity.},

Cognitive mechanisms underlying the delay of gratification in young children have been examined extensively. However, the neural mechanism of this process is largely unknown. The present study examined whether inferior prefrontal regions play an important role in the delay of gratification choice paradigm in young children. Preschool children were given a choice version of a delay of gratification task, and their neural activation during the task was assessed using near‐infrared spectroscopy in cross‐sectional (Study 1) and longitudinal designs (Study 2). Results revealed the activation of the right inferior prefrontal regions of children during the task in both studies. Specifically, the inferior prefrontal regions of the children were activated during immediate choices but not during delay choices. This study is the first to demonstrate the neural correlates of the delay of gratification in young children. We discuss how the right inferior prefrontal regions of preschool children are activated during the delay of gratification.},

   pages = {692-702},
   abstract = {While much research has focused on understanding how individual stimuli are encoded in episodic memory, less is known about how a series of events is bound into a coherent episode. Cognitive models of episodic memory propose that information about presented stimuli is integrated into a composite representation reﬂecting one's past experience, allowing events separated in time to become associated. Recent evidence suggests that neural oscillatory activity may be critically involved in this process. To examine how oscillatory activity contributes to binding of information across events, we measured scalp EEG as participants studied categorized lists of people, places, and objects. We assessed their memory for the lists using free recall, allowing us to characterize the temporal and semantic organization of the studied items in memory. Using pattern classiﬁcation, we identiﬁed EEG activity during encoding at a range of frequencies and scalp locations that was sensitive to the category of presented stimuli. In the beta band (16–25 Hz) at right posterior electrodes, we observed activity that was also sensitive to the category of recently presented stimuli. This neural activity showed two characteristics consistent with a representation of the recent past: It became stronger when multiple items from the same category were presented in succession, and it contained a fading trace of the previous category after a category shift. When items were separated by an inter-item distraction task, this integrative beta-band activity was disrupted. Distraction also led to decreased semantic organization of the studied materials without aﬀecting their temporal organization; this suggests that distraction disrupts the integration of semantic information over time, preventing encoding of items in terms of the semantic context of earlier items. Our results provide evidence that beta-band activity is involved in maintaining information about recent events, allowing construction of a coherent representation of a temporally extended episode in memory.},

   abstract = {Use of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to predict the cognitive state of a subject during task performance has become a popular focus of fMRI studies. The input to these analyses consists of activation patterns corresponding to different tasks or stimulus types. These activation patterns are fairly straightforward to calculate for blocked trials or slow event-related designs, but for rapid event-related designs the evoked BOLD signal for adjacent trials will overlap in time, complicating the identification of signal unique to specific trials. Rapid event-related designs are often preferred because they allow for more stimuli to be presented and subjects tend to be more focused on the task, and thus it would be beneficial to be able to use these types of designs in MVPA analyses. The present work compares 8 different models for estimating trial-by-trial activation patterns for a range of rapid event-related designs varying by interstimulus interval and signal-to-noise ratio. The most effective approach obtains each trial's estimate through a general linear model including a regressor for that trial as well as another regressor for all other trials. Through the analysis of both simulated and real data we have found that this model shows some improvement over the standard approaches for obtaining activation patterns. The resulting trial-by-trial estimates are more representative of the true activation magnitudes, leading to a boost in classification accuracy in fast event-related designs with higher signal-to-noise. This provides the potential for fMRI studies that allow simultaneous optimization of both univariate and MVPA approaches.},

   abstract = {Dopaminergic networks modulate neural processing across a spectrum of function from perception to learning to action. Multiple organizational schemes based on anatomy and function have been proposed for dopaminergic nuclei in the midbrain. One schema originating in rodent models delineated ventral tegmental area (VTA), implicated in complex behaviors like addiction, from more lateral substantia nigra (SN), preferentially implicated in movement. However, because anatomy and function in rodent midbrain differs from the primate midbrain in important ways, the utility of this distinction for human neuroscience has been questioned. We asked whether functional definition of networks within the human dopaminergic midbrain would recapitulate this traditional anatomical topology. We first developed a method for reliably defining SN and VTA in humans at conventional MRI resolution. Hand-drawn VTA and SN regions-of-interest (ROIs) were constructed for 50 participants, using individually-localized anatomical landmarks and signal intensity. Individual segmentation was used in seed-based functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional MRI data; results of this analysis recapitulated traditional anatomical targets of the VTA versus SN. Next, we constructed a probabilistic atlas of the VTA, SN, and the dopaminergic midbrain region (comprised of SN plus VTA) from individual hand-drawn ROIs. The combined probabilistic (SN plus VTA) ROI was then used for connectivity-based dual-regression analysis in two independent resting-state datasets (n = 69 and n = 79). Results of the connectivity-based, dual-regression functional segmentation recapitulated results of the anatomical segmentation, validating the utility of this probabilistic atlas for future research.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade fMRI researchers have developed increasingly sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear classiﬁcation, a simple technique for decoding information about experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based encoding model, which describes the information about the stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations: encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in practice these two operations are often confused, and their respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear. Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate some of the most common questions about how information is represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding model can in principle provide a complete functional description of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is much more difﬁcult to derive an encoding model from a decoding model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.},

   abstract = {Connectivity hyperalignment can be used to estimate a single shared response space across disjoint datasets. We develop a connectivity-based shared response model that factorizes aggregated fMRI datasets into a single reduced-dimension shared connectivity space and subject-speciﬁc topographic transformations. These transformations resolve idiosyncratic functional topographies and can be used to project response time series into shared space. We evaluate this algorithm on a large collection of heterogeneous, naturalistic fMRI datasets acquired while subjects listened to spoken stories. Projecting subject data into shared space dramatically improves between-subject story time-segment classiﬁcation and increases the dimensionality of shared information across subjects. This improvement generalizes to subjects and stories excluded when estimating the shared space. We demonstrate that estimating a simple semantic encoding model in shared space improves between-subject forward encoding and inverted encoding model performance. The shared space estimated across all datasets is distinct from the shared space derived from any particular constituent dataset; the algorithm leverages shared connectivity to yield a consensus shared space conjoining diverse story stimuli.},

In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientific perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are known to be systematically wrong? How might “toy problems” tell a misleading story? How does the scientific goal of explanation align with (or differ from) traditional statistical concerns?

The method relies on the observation that there are two distinct infinite series expansions of this probability density, one of which converges quickly for small time values, while the other converges quickly at large time values. By deriving error bounds associated with finite truncation of either expansion, we are able to determine analytically which of the two versions should be applied in any particular context. The bounds indicate that, even for extremely stringent error tolerances, no more than 8 terms are required to calculate the probability density. By making the calculation of this distribution tractable, the goal is to allow more complex extensions of Wiener diffusion models to be developed.},

   abstract = {The authors propose and test an exemplar-based random walk model for predicting response times in tasks of speeded, multidimensional perceptual classification. The model combines elements of R. M. Nosofsky's (1986) generalized context model of categorization and G. D. Logan's (1988) instance-based model of automaticity. In the model, exemplars race among one another to be retrieved from memory, with rates determined by their similarity to test items. The retrieved exemplars provide incremental information that enters into a random walk process for making classification decisions. The model predicts correctly effects of within- and between-categories similarity, individual-object familiarity, and extended practice on classification response times. It also builds bridges between the domains of categorization and automaticity. Models of multidimensional perceptual classification have grown increasingly powerful and sophisticated in recent years, providing detailed quantitative accounts of patterns of classification learning, transfer, and generalization (e.g., Anderson},

   abstract = {Perceptual decision making can be accounted for by drift-diffusion models, a class of decisionmaking models that assume a stochastic accumulation of evidence on each trial. Fitting response time and accuracy to a drift-diffusion model produces evidence accumulation rate and non-decision time parameter estimates that reflect cognitive processes. Our goal is to elucidate the effect of attention on visual decision making. In this study, we show that measures of attention obtained from simultaneous EEG recordings can explain per-trial evidence accumulation rates and perceptual preprocessing times during a visual decision making task. Models assuming linear relationships between diffusion model parameters and EEG measures as external inputs were fit in a single step in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The EEG measures were features of the evoked potential (EP) to the onset of a masking noise and the onset of a task-relevant signal stimulus. Single-trial evoked EEG responses, P200s to the onsets of visual noise and N200s to the onsets of visual signal, explain single-trial evidence accumulation and preprocessing times. Within-trial evidence accumulation variance was not found to be influenced by attention to the signal or noise. Single-trial measures of attention lead to better out-of-sample predictions of accuracy and correct reaction time distributions for individual subjects.},

   abstract = {Temporal difference learning has been proposed as a model for Pavlovian conditioning, in which an animal learns to predict delivery of reward following presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS). A key component of this model is a prediction error signal, which, before learning, responds at the time of presentation of reward but, after learning, shifts its response to the time of onset of the CS. In order to test for regions manifesting this signal profile, subjects were scanned using event-related fMRI while undergoing appetitive conditioning with a pleasant taste reward. Regression analyses revealed that responses in ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex were significantly correlated with this error signal, suggesting that, during appetitive conditioning, computations described by temporal difference learning are expressed in the human brain.},

This review will briefly summarize the approach of model-based fMRI, with reference to the field of reward learning and decision making, where computational models have been used to probe the neural mechanisms underlying learning of reward associations, modifying action choice to obtain reward, as well as in encoding expected value signals that reflect the abstract structure of a decision problem. Finally, some of the limitations of this approach will be discussed.},

Four decision theories are examined: rational models, bounded rationality, evidence accumulation, and parallel constraint satisfaction models. Although most theories were conﬁrmed with regard to certain predictions, none of the theories adequately accounted for the role of attention during decision making. Several observations emerged concerning the drivers and down-stream effects of attention on choice, suggesting that attention processes plays an active role in constructing decisions. So far, decision theories have largely ignored the constructive role of attention by assuming that it is entirely determined by heuristics, or that it consists of stochastic information sampling. The empirical observations reveal that these assumptions are implausible, and that more accurate assumptions could have been made based on prior attention and eye movement research. Future decision making research would beneﬁt from greater integration with attention research.},

   abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is vulnerable to normal and pathologic aging. Currently, layer resolution large-scale proteomic studies describing "normal" age-related alterations at OFC are not available. Here, we performed a large-scale exploratory high-throughput mass spectrometry-based protein analysis on OFC layer 2/3 from 15 "young" (15-43 years) and 18 "old" (62-88 years) human male subjects. We detected 4193 proteins and identified 127 differentially expressed (DE) proteins (p-value </=0.05; effect size >20%), including 65 up- and 62 downregulated proteins (e.g., GFAP, CALB1). Using a previously described categorization of biological aging based on somatic tissues, that is, peripheral "hallmarks of aging," and considering overlap in protein function, we show the highest representation of altered cell-cell communication (54%), deregulated nutrient sensing (39%), and loss of proteostasis (35%) in the set of OFC layer 2/3 DE proteins. DE proteins also showed a significant association with several neurologic disorders; for example, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Notably, despite age-related changes in individual protein levels, protein co-expression modules were remarkably conserved across age groups, suggesting robust functional homeostasis. Collectively, these results provide biological insight into aging and associated homeostatic mechanisms that maintain normal brain function with advancing age.},

   journal = {Journal of Experimental Psychology: General},
   pages = {23},
   abstract = {There is a disconnect in the literature between analyses of risky choice based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT) and work on predecisional information processing. One likely reason is that for expectation models (e.g., CPT), it is often assumed that people behaved only as if they conducted the computations leading to the predicted choice and that the models are thus mute regarding information processing. We suggest that key psychological constructs in CPT, such as loss aversion and outcome and probability sensitivity, can be interpreted in terms of attention allocation. In two experiments, we tested hypotheses about specific links between CPT parameters and attentional regularities. Experiment 1 used process tracing to monitor participants’ predecisional attention allocation to outcome and probability information. As hypothesized, individual differences in CPT’s loss-aversion, outcome-sensitivity, and probability-sensitivity parameters (estimated from participants’ choices) were systematically associated with individual differences in attention allocation to outcome and probability information. For instance, loss aversion was associated with the relative attention allocated to loss and gain outcomes, and a more strongly curved weighting function was associated with less attention allocated to probabilities. Experiment 2 manipulated participants’ attention to losses or gains, causing systematic differences in CPT’s loss-aversion parameter. This result indicates that attention allocation can to some extent cause choice regularities that are captured by CPT. Our findings demonstrate an as-if model’s capacity to reflect characteristics of information processing. We suggest that the observed CPT–attention links can be harnessed to inform the development of process models of risky choice.},

Mathematical psychology, and cognitive modeling more generally, has a rich history of formalizing and testing hypotheses about cognitive mechanisms within a mathematical and computational language, making exquisite predictions of how people perceive, learn, remember, and decide. Cognitive neuroscience aims to identify neural mechanisms associated with key aspects of cognition using techniques like neurophysiology, electrophysiology, and structural and functional brain imaging. These two come together in a powerful new approach called model-based cognitive neuroscience, which can both inform cognitive modeling and help to interpret neural measures. Cognitive models decompose complex behavior into representations and processes and these latent model states can be used to explain the modulation of brain states under different experimental conditions. Reciprocally, neural measures provide data that help constrain cognitive models and adjudicate between competing cognitive models that make similar predictions about behavior. As examples, brain measures are related to cognitive model parameters fitted to individual participant data, measures of brain dynamics are related to measures of model dynamics, model parameters are constrained by neural measures, model parameters or model states are used in statistical analyses of neural data, or neural and behavioral data are analyzed jointly within a hierarchical modeling framework. We provide an introduction to the field of model-based cognitive neuroscience and to the articles contained within this special issue.},

   abstract = {Mathematical psychology and systems neuroscience have converged on stochastic accumulator models to explain decision making. We examined saccade decisions in monkeys while neurophysiological recordings were made within their frontal eye ﬁeld. Accumulator models were tested on how well they ﬁt response probabilities and distributions of response times to make saccades. We connected these models with neurophysiology. To test the hypothesis that visually responsive neurons represented perceptual evidence driving accumulation, we replaced perceptual processing time and drift rate parameters with recorded neurophysiology from those neurons. To test the hypothesis that movement related neurons instantiated the accumulator, we compared measures of neural dynamics with predicted measures of accumulator dynamics. Thus, neurophysiology both provides a constraint on model assumptions and data for model selection. We highlight a gated accumulator model that accounts for saccade behavior during visual search, predicts neurophysiology during search, and provides insights into the locus of cognitive control over decisions.},

The solution for the unmixing matrix is given by the generalized eigenvectors that simultaneously diagonalize the covariance matrix of the observations and an additional symmetric matrix whose form depends upon the particular assumptions. The method critically determines the mixture coefﬁcients and is therefore not robust to estimation errors. However it provides a rather general and uniﬁed solution that summarizes the conditions for successful blind source separation. To demonstrate the method, which can be implemented in two lines of matlab code, we present results for artiﬁcial mixtures of speech and real mixtures of electroencephalography (EEG) data, showing that the same sources are recovered under the various assumptions.},

   abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often used to diagnose diseases such as seizure, alzheimer, and schizophrenia. One main problem with the recorded EEG samples is that they are not equally reliable due to the artifacts at the time of recording. EEG signal classiﬁcation algorithms should have a mechanism to handle this issue. It seems that using adaptive classiﬁers can be useful for the biological signals such as EEG. In this paper, a general adaptive method named weighted distance nearest neighbor (WDNN) is applied for EEG signal classiﬁcation to tackle this problem. This classiﬁcation algorithm assigns a weight to each training sample to control its inﬂuence in classifying test samples. The weights of training samples are used to ﬁnd the nearest neighbor of an input query pattern. To assess the performance of this scheme, EEG signals of thirteen schizophrenic patients and eighteen normal subjects are analyzed for the classiﬁcation of these two groups. Several features including, fractal dimension, band power and autoregressive (AR) model are extracted from EEG signals. The classiﬁcation results are evaluated using Leave one (subject) out cross validation for reliable estimation. The results indicate that combination of WDNN and selected features can signiﬁcantly outperform the basic nearest-neighbor and the other methods proposed in the past for the classiﬁcation of these two groups. Therefore, this method can be a complementary tool for specialists to distinguish schizophrenia disorder.},

   journal = {Computational Brain & Behavior},
   abstract = {Cognitive models have been instrumental for generating insights into the brain processes underlying learning and decision making. In reinforcement learning it has recently been shown that not only choice proportions but also their latency distributions can be well captured when the choice function is replaced with a sequential sampling model such as the drift diffusion model. Hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation further enhances the identifiability of distinct learning and choice parameters. One caveat is that these models can be time-consuming to build, sample from, and validate, especially when models include links between neural activations and model parameters. Here we describe a novel extension to the widely used hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM) toolbox, which facilitates flexible construction, estimation, and evaluation of the reinforcement learning drift diffusion model (RLDDM) using hierarchical Bayesian methods. We describe the types of experiments most applicable to the model and provide a tutorial to illustrate how to perform quantitative data analysis and model evaluation. Parameter recovery confirmed that the method can reliably estimate parameters with varying numbers of synthetic subjects and trials. We also show that the simultaneous estimation of learning and choice parameters can improve the sensitivity to detect brain–behavioral relationships, including the impact of learned values and fronto-basal ganglia activity patterns on dynamic decision parameters.},

Developmental studies have shown important changes in control systems between infancy and childhood. In some cases, evidence has supported the role of speciﬁc genetic variations, often in conjunction with experience, that account for some of the individual differences in the efﬁciency of attentional networks. The ﬁndings have led to increased understanding of aspects of pathology and to some new interventions.},

   abstract = {Many theorists assume that the cognitive system is composed of a collection of encapsulated processing components or modules, each dedicated to performing a particular cognitive function. On this view, selective impairments of cognitive tasks following brain damage, as evidenced by double dissociations, are naturally interpreted in terms of the loss of particular processing components. By contrast, the current investigation examines in detail a double dissociation between concrete and abstract work reading after damage to a connectionist network that pronounces words via meaning and yet has no separable components (Plaut & Shallice, 1993). The functional specialization in the network that gives rise to the double dissociation is not transparently related to the network's structure, as modular theories assume. Furthermore, a consideration of the distribution of effects across quantitatively equivalent individual lesions in the network raises specific concerns about the interpretation of single-case studies. The findings underscore the necessity of relating neuropsychological data to cognitive theories in the context of specific computational assumptions about how the cognitive system operates normally and after damage.},

   abstract = {Computational models of decision making typically assume as people deliberate between options they mentally simulate outcomes from each one and integrate valuations of these outcomes to form a preference. In two studies, we investigated this deliberation process using a task where participants make a series of decisions between a certain and an uncertain option, which were shown as dynamic visual samples that represented possible payoffs. We developed and validated a method of reverse correlational analysis for the task that measures how this time-varying signal was used to make a choice. The ﬁrst study used this method to examine how information processing during deliberation differed from a perceptual analog of the task. We found that participants were less sensitive to each sample of information during preferential choice. In a second study, we investigated how these different measures of deliberation were related to impulsivity and drug and alcohol use. We found that although properties of the deliberation process were not related to impulsivity, some aspects of the process may be related to substance use. In particular, alcohol abuse was related to diminished sensitivity to the payoff information and drug use was related to how the initial starting point of evidence accumulation. We synthesized our results with a rank-dependent sequential sampling model which suggests that participants allocated more attentional weight to larger potential payoffs during preferential choice.},

Perceptual decisions are determined by objective states of the world (e.g., melons are bigger than apples), whereas value-based decisions are determined by subjective preferences (e.g., I prefer apples to melons). Theoretical accounts suggest that both types of choice involve neural computations accumulating evidence for the choice alternatives; however, little is known about the overlap or differences in the processes underlying perceptual versus value-based decisions. We analyzed EEG recordings during a paradigm where perceptualand value-based choices were based on identical stimuli. For both types of choice, evidence accumulation was evident in parietal gamma-frequency oscillations, whereas a similar frontal signal was unique for value-based decisions. Fronto-parietal synchronization of these signals predicted valuebased choice accuracy. These ﬁndings uncover how decisions emerge from topographic- and frequency-speciﬁc oscillations that accumulate distinct aspects of evidence, with large-scale synchronization as a mechanism integrating these spatially distributed signals.},

The current study examined category learning in older adults using this well-known category set. Older adults, like younger adults, found category tasks with a single relevant dimension the easiest to learn. In contrast to younger adults, older adults found complex disjunctive rule-based categories harder to learn than family resemblance based categories. Disjunctive rule-based category learning appeared to be the most difficult for older adults to learn because this category set placed the heaviest demands on working memory, which is known to be a cognitive function that declines with normal aging. The authors discuss why complex rule-based category learning is considered more difficult for older adults to learn relative to younger adults, drawing parallels to developmental research.},

   abstract = {The diffusion model for two-choice real-time decisions is applied to four psychophysical tasks. The model reveals how stimulus information guides decisions and shows how the information is processed through time to yield sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect decisions. Rapid two-choice decisions yield multiple empirical measures: response times for correct and error responses, the probabilities of correct and error responses, and a variety of interactions between accuracy and response time that depend on instructions and task difficulty. The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do. Variability within the decision process explains how errors are made, and variability across trials correctly predicts when errors are faster than correct responses and when they are slower.},

   abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) signals correspond to propagating electrophysiological infra-slow activity (<0.1 Hz). Thus, pairwise correlations (zero-lag functional connectivity (FC)) and temporal delays among regional rsfMRI signals provide useful, complementary descriptions of spatiotemporal structure in infra-slow activity. However, the slow nature of fMRI signals implies that practical scan durations cannot provide sufficient independent temporal samples to stabilize either of these measures. Here, we examine factors affecting sampling variability in both time delay estimation (TDE) and FC. Although both TDE and FC accuracy are highly sensitive to data quantity, we use surrogate fMRI time series to study how the former is additionally related to the magnitude of a given pairwise correlation and, to a lesser extent, the temporal sampling rate. These contingencies are further explored in real data comprising 30-min rsfMRI scans, where sampling error (i.e., limited accuracy owing to insufficient data quantity) emerges as a significant but underappreciated challenge to FC and, even more so, to TDE. Exclusion of high-motion epochs exacerbates sampling error; thus, both sides of the bias-variance (or data quality-quantity) tradeoff associated with data exclusion should be considered when analyzing rsfMRI data. Finally, we present strategies for TDE in motion-corrupted data, for characterizing sampling error in TDE and FC, and for mitigating the influence of sampling error on lag-based analyses.},

   abstract = {Cross-sectional and longitudinal findings from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study indicate that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is among those regions vulnerable to age-associated tissue loss in older adults without dementia. Neuropathologic and recent in vivo amyloid imaging studies indicate that the OFC is also among the earliest neocortical regions to show deposition of amyloid plaques in aging and Alzheimer's disease. We performed behavioral and imaging studies to investigate age effects on specific aspects of OFC function. We compared performance in young (age 20-40) and old (age 60 and older) adults on cognitive tasks selected for differential sensitivity to OFC versus dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Overall, greater age differences were seen in the OFC tasks compared to DLPFC tasks, with Delayed Match and Non-Match to Sample tasks showing the greatest effect size among OFC tasks and Self-Ordered Pointing Task showing the greatest effect size among DLPFC tasks. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted in parallel to probe the neural underpinnings of age differences in OFC function using the Delayed Match and Non-Match to Sample paradigm. Young but not old adults showed the expected OFC activation. Older compared with young adults showed greater activation in association with successful performance for several posterior regions, perhaps indicating compensation in the face of OFC deficits. Together, these findings indicate a vulnerability of the OFC to age-related decline in brain structure and function. Future studies using new in vivo imaging probes will help determine whether neuropathologic changes underlie the structural and functional changes.},

   abstract = {Learning usually improves the accuracy of beliefs through the accumulation of experience. But are there limits to learning that prevent us from accurately understanding our world? In this article we investigate the concept of a “learning trap”—the formation of a stable false belief even with extensive experience. Our review highlights how these traps develop through the interaction of learning and decision making in unknown environments. We further document a particularly pernicious learning trap driven by selective attention, a mechanism often assumed to facilitate learning in complex environments. Using computer simulation, we demonstrate the key attributes of the agent and environment that lead to this new type of learning trap. Then, in a series of experiments we present evidence that people robustly fall into this trap, even in the presence of various interventions predicted to meliorate it. These results highlight a fundamental limit to learning and adaptive behavior that impacts individuals, organizations, animals, and machines.},

   abstract = {Functional connectivity analysis of fMRI data can reveal synchronised activity between anatomically distinct brain regions. Here, we extract the characteristic connectivity signatures of different brain states to perform classiﬁcation, allowing us to decode the different states based on the functional connectivity patterns. Our approach is based on polythetic decision trees, which combine powerful discriminative ability with interpretability of results. We also propose to use ensemble of classiﬁers within speciﬁc frequency subbands, and show that they bring systematic improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy. Exploiting multi-band classiﬁcation of connectivity graphs is also proposed, and we explain theoretical reasons why the technique could bring further improvement in classiﬁcation performance. The choice of decision trees as classiﬁer is shown to provide a practical way to identify a subset of connections that distinguishes best between the conditions, permitting the extraction of very compact representations for differences between brain states, which we call discriminative graphs. Our experimental results based on strict train/test separation at all stages of processing show that the method is applicable to inter-subject brain decoding with relatively low error rates for the task considered.},

However, the neural computations that are explained by RL algorithms fall short of explaining many sophisticated aspects of human decision making, including the generalization of learned information, one-shot learning, and the synthesis of task information in complex environments. Instead, these aspects of instrumental behavior are assumed to be supported by the brain’s executive functions (EF). We review recent findings that highlight the importance of EF in learning. Specifically, we advance the theory that EF sets the stage for canonical RL computations in the brain, providing inputs that broaden their flexibility and applicability. Our theory has important implications for how to interpret RL computations in the brain and behavior.},

   abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to detect and delineate regions of the brain that change their level of activation in response to specific stimuli and tasks. Simple activation maps depict only the average level of engagement of different regions within distributed systems. FMRI potentially can reveal additional information about the degree to which components of large-scale neural systems are functionally coupled together to achieve specific tasks. In order to better understand how brain regions contribute to functionally connected circuits, it is necessary to record activation maps either as a function of different conditions, at different times or in different subjects. Data obtained under different conditions may then be analyzed by a variety of techniques to infer correlations and couplings between nodes in networks. Several multivariate statistical methods have been adapted and applied to analyze variations within such data. An approach of particular interest that is suited to studies of connectivity within single subjects makes use of acquisitions of runs of MRI images obtained while the brain is in a so-called steady state, either at rest (i.e., without any specific stimulus or task) or in a condition of continuous activation. Interregional correlations between fluctuations of MRI signal potentially reveal functional connectivity. Recent studies have established that interregional correlations between different components of circuits in each of the visual, language, motor and working memory systems can be detected in the resting state. Correlations at baseline are changed during the performance of a continuous task. In this review, various methods available for assessing connectivity are described and evaluated.},

This form leads to an interpretation that the strength of evidence is relative predictive accuracy. With this approach, students are encouraged to view Bayes’ theorem as an updating mechanism, to obtain a deeper appreciation of the role of the prior and of marginal data, and to view estimation and model comparison from a uniﬁed perspective.},

   abstract = {Successful behavior requires actively acquiring and representing information about the environment and people, and manipulating and using those acquired representations flexibly to optimally act in and on the world. The frontal lobes have figured prominently in most accounts of flexible or goal-directed behavior, as evidenced by often-reported behavioral inflexibility in individuals with frontal lobe dysfunction. Here, we propose that the hippocampus also plays a critical role by forming and reconstructing relational memory representations that underlie flexible cognition and social behavior. There is mounting evidence that damage to the hippocampus can produce inflexible and maladaptive behavior when such behavior places high demands on the generation, recombination, and flexible use of information. This is seen in abilities as diverse as memory, navigation, exploration, imagination, creativity, decision-making, character judgments, establishing and maintaining social bonds, empathy, social discourse, and language use. Thus, the hippocampus, together with its extensive interconnections with other neural systems, supports the flexible use of information in general. Further, we suggest that this understanding has important clinical implications. Hippocampal abnormalities can produce profound deficits in real-world situations, which typically place high demands on the flexible use of information, but are not always obvious on diagnostic tools tuned to frontal lobe function. This review documents the role of the hippocampus in supporting flexible representations and aims to expand our understanding of the dynamic networks that operate as we move through and create meaning of our world.},

   journal = {Journal of Neuroscience Methods},
   volume = {268},
   pages = {142-153},
   abstract = {Background: Causal estimation methods are increasingly being used to investigate functional brain networks in fMRI, but there are continuing concerns about the validity of these methods. New method: Multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) is a state-space method for estimating dynamic causal interactions in fMRI data. Here we validate MDS using benchmark simulations as well as simulations from a more realistic stochastic neurophysiological model. Finally, we applied MDS to investigate dynamic casual interactions in a fronto-cingulate-parietal control network using human connectome project (HCP) data acquired during performance of a working memory task. Crucially, since the ground truth in experimental data is unknown, we conducted novel stability analysis to determine robust causal interactions within this network. Results: MDS accurately recovered dynamic causal interactions with an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) above 0.7 for benchmark datasets and AUC above 0.9 for datasets generated using the neurophysiological model. In experimental fMRI data, bootstrap procedures revealed a stable pattern of causal inﬂuences from the anterior insula to other nodes of the fronto-cingulate-parietal network. Comparison with existing methods: MDS is effective in estimating dynamic causal interactions in both the benchmark and neurophysiological model based datasets in terms of AUC, sensitivity and false positive rates. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings demonstrate that MDS can accurately estimate causal interactions in fMRI data. Neurophysiological models and stability analysis provide a general framework for validating computational methods designed to estimate causal interactions in fMRI. The right anterior insula functions as a causal hub during working memory.},

This non-normative eﬀect has been found in a variety of tasks and has been taken as evidence that people inappropriately combine information. In a series of ﬁve experiments, we found the dilution eﬀect, but surprisingly it was not due to the inaccurate combination of diagnostic and non-diagnostic information. Because we have objectively correct answers for our task, we could see that participants were relatively accurate in judging diagnostic evidence combined with non-diagnostic evidence, but overestimated the strength of diagnostic evidence alone. This meant that the dilution eﬀect – the gap between diagnostic evidence alone and diagnostic evidence combined with non-diagnostic evidence – was not caused by dilution. We hypothesized that participants were ﬁlling in “missing” evidence in a biased fashion when presented with diagnostic evidence alone. This hypothesis best explained the experimental results.},

Neuroimaging studies suggest that central executive processes are related to a complex fronto-parietal network. In the present study we investigate the question whether varying demands on central executive processes are reflected by differences in coherent activity between and within a fronto-parietal network. We calculated coherence during a visuospatial working memory task. Under an easy executive condition subjects had to mentally imagine previously studied abstract patterns, whereas in the difficult condition, subjects had to mentally manipulate these patterns. The results indicate the involvement of prefrontal areas in executive functions reflected by a decrease of anterior upper alpha short-range connectivity and a parallel increase of fronto-parietal longrange coherence mirroring activation of a fronto-parietal network.},

   abstract = {Cognitive control and self-control are often used as interchangeable terms. Both terms refer to the ability to pursue long-term goals, but the types of controlled behavior that are typically associated with these terms diﬀer, at least superﬁcially. Cognitive control is observed in the control of attention and the overcoming of habitual responses, while self-control is observed in resistance to short-term impulses and temptations. Evidence from clinical studies and neuroimaging studies suggests that below these superﬁcial diﬀerences, common control process (e.g., inhibition) might guide both types of controlled behavior. Here, we study this hypothesis in a behavioral experiment, which interlaced trials of a Simon task with trials of an intertemporal decision task. If cognitive control and self-control depend on a common control process, we expected conﬂict adaptation from Simon task trials to lead to increased self-control in the intertemporal decision trials. However, despite successful manipulations of conﬂict and conﬂict adaptation, we found no evidence for this hypothesis. We investigate a number of alternative explanations of this result and conclude that the diﬀerences between cognitive control and self-control are not superﬁcial, but rather reﬂect diﬀerences at the process level.},

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a pattern classiﬁcation algorithm to predict the attentional state of human observers as they monitored a visual feature (one of two directions of motion). We ﬁnd that featurespeciﬁc attention effects spread across the visual ﬁeld—even to regions of the scene that do not contain a stimulus.

   journal = {Computational Brain & Behavior},
   abstract = {For many decisions in life, there is uncertainty about the outcome even if the stimulus is a familiar one. Under these circumstances, people often rely upon previous experience to make a choice. In general, more accurate responding is achieved when one considers decision-relevant information for longer. There are practical limits, however, to how long one can deliberate, and so decision-makers must balance decision speed against accuracy. Traditionally, the overall speed with which people respond has been understood in terms of changes in the evidence threshold used for decision-making. However, more recent findings suggest that speed pressure may also affect the quality of information people recruit for making decisions. The current study investigated the effects of emphasizing either response speed or response accuracy on decision-making in a probabilistic category learning task. Strikingly, conclusions from two model-based analyses of performance depended on whether data were analyzed at the level of individuals or the group average. For the group-level analyses, speed pressure selectively influenced evidence threshold. For the individual-level analyses, speed pressure affected both evidence threshold as well as the quality of information driving decision-making for four out of six participants. Our findings are consistent with recent results that identify common brain areas associated with setting evidence thresholds decision-making and representing category-level information in trial-by-trial associative learning.},

   title = {Odor-evoked category reactivation in human ventromedial prefrontal cortex during sleep promotes memory consolidation},
   journal = {eLife},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {e39681},
   abstract = {Slow-wave sleep is an optimal opportunity for memory consolidation: when encoding occurs in the presence of a sensory cue, delivery of that cue during sleep enhances retrieval of associated memories. Recent studies suggest that cues might promote consolidation by inducing neural reinstatement of cue-associated content during sleep, but direct evidence for such mechanisms is scant, and the relevant brain areas supporting these processes are poorly understood. Here, we address these gaps by combining a novel olfactory cueing paradigm with an object-location memory task and simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in human subjects. Using pattern analysis of fMRI ensemble activity, we find that presentation of odor cues during sleep promotes reactivation of category-level information in ventromedial prefrontal cortex that significantly correlates with post-sleep memory performance. In identifying the potential mechanisms by which odor cues selectively modulate memory in the sleeping brain, these findings bring unique insights into elucidating how and what we remember. , It may not always feel like it, but we encounter an incredible volume of new information every day. We experience so much that it is not feasible to remember every detail. The brain's process for reorganizing memories – keeping some secure and discarding others – is known as memory consolidation. There are ways of directing consolidation toward certain memories. One of them is to associate a memory – such as an arrangement of objects – with a particular smell. If this odor is then wafted at the person when they sleep, they are better at recalling the associated memory the next day. The neural mechanisms in the brain that support this process are largely unknown. Researchers want to find out exactly how odor cues can alter brain activity while participants are asleep to allow for better recall on awakening. Shanahan et al. used fMRI scans to see how an odor affects the sleeping brain. First, the participants learned the locations of several objects on a four by four grid – including animals, faces, buildings and tools – and then learned to associate each category with a different background odor. Then, the volunteers took a nighttime nap inside the MRI scanner, and were exposed to two of the odors in their sleep. The next morning, they better remembered the locations of the objects from the two categories associated with the odor cues delivered in sleep. Analyses of the brain scans revealed that the extent to which odors reactivated the category information in a part of the brain called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was predictive of how successful memory recall was after sleep. This brain region is involved in retrieving old memories. Memory disorders are an ever-increasing problem as the average life-span continues to rise. Reliable treatments to slow or prevent memory decline in patients with conditions such as Alzheimer's are still unavailable. Using odor cues during sleep could be one way to enhance memories in patients with memory loss and dementia, but also in healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {Stereotype formation may be based on the exaggeration of real group differences (category accentuation) or the misperception of group differences that do not exist (illusory correlation). This research sought to account for both phenomena with J. K. Kruschke’s (1996, 2001, 2003) attention theory of category learning. According to the model, the features of majority groups are learned earlier than the features of minority groups. In turn, the features that become associated with a minority are those that most distinguish it from the majority. This second process is driven by an attention-shifting mechanism that directs attention toward group–attribute pairings that facilitate differentiation of the two groups and may lead to the formation of stronger minority stereotypes. Five experiments supported this model as a common account for category accentuation and distinctiveness-based illusory correlation. Implications for the natures of stereotype formation, illusory correlation, and impression formation are discussed.},

   abstract = {Decisions are often guided by generalizing from past experiences. Fundamental questions remain regarding the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which generalization takes place. Prior data suggest that generalization may stem from inference-based processes at the time of generalization. By contrast, generalization may emerge from mnemonic processes occurring while premise events are encoded. Here, participants engaged in a two-phase learning and generalization task, wherein they learned a series of overlapping associations and subsequently generalized what they learned to novel stimulus combinations. Functional MRI revealed that successful generalization was associated with coupled changes in learning-phase activity in the hippocampus and midbrain (ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra). These findings provide evidence for generalization based on integrative encoding, whereby overlapping past events are integrated into a linked mnemonic representation. Hippocampal-midbrain interactions support the dynamic integration of experiences, providing a powerful mechanism for building a rich associative history that extends beyond individual events.},

Much of this knowledge requires concepts and this study focuses on how people acquire concepts. It is argued that conceptual development progresses from simple perceptual grouping to highly abstract scientiﬁc concepts. This proposal of conceptual development has four parts. First, it is argued that categories in the world have different structure. Second, there might be different learning systems (subserved by different brain mechanisms) that evolved to learn categories of differing structures. Third, these systems exhibit differential maturational course, which affects how categories of different structures are learned in the course of development. And ﬁnally, an interaction of these components may result in the developmental transition from perceptual groupings to more abstract concepts. This study reviews a large body of empirical evidence supporting this proposal.},

   journal = {Cognitive Psychology},
   volume = {97},
   pages = {1-30},
   abstract = {Word learning is a notoriously difﬁcult induction problem because meaning is underdetermined by positive examples. How do children solve this problem? Some have argued that word learning is achieved by means of inference: young word learners rely on a number of assumptions that reduce the overall hypothesis space by favoring some meanings over others. However, these approaches have difﬁculty explaining how words are learned from conversations or text, without pointing or explicit instruction. In this research, we propose an associative mechanism that can account for such learning. In a series of experiments, 4-year-olds and adults were presented with sets of words that included a single nonsense word (e.g. dax). Some lists were taxonomic (i.,e., all items were members of a given category), some were associative (i.e., all items were associates of a given category, but not members), and some were mixed. Participants were asked to indicate whether the nonsense word was an animal or an artifact. Adults exhibited evidence of learning when lists consisted of either associatively or taxonomically related items. In contrast, children exhibited evidence of word learning only when lists consisted of associatively related items. These results present challenges to several extant models of word learning, and a new model based on the distinction between syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations is proposed.},

   volume = {7},
   abstract = {The number and variety of connectivity estimation methods is likely to continue to grow over the coming decade. Comparisons between methods are necessary to prune this growth to only the most accurate and robust methods. However, the nature of connectivity is elusive with different methods potentially attempting to identify different aspects of connectivity. Commonalities of connectivity deﬁnitions across methods upon which base direct comparisons can be difﬁcult to derive. Here, we explicitly deﬁne “effective connectivity” using a common set of observation and state equations that are appropriate for three connectivity methods: dynamic causal modeling (DCM), multivariate autoregressive modeling (MAR), and switching linear dynamic systems for fMRI (sLDSf). In addition while deriving this set, we show how many other popular functional and effective connectivity methods are actually simpliﬁcations of these equations. We discuss implications of these connections for the practice of using one method to simulate data for another method. After mathematically connecting the three effective connectivity methods, simulated fMRI data with varying numbers of regions and task conditions is generated from the common equation. This simulated data explicitly contains the type of the connectivity that the three models were intended to identify. Each method is applied to the simulated data sets and the accuracy of parameter identiﬁcation is analyzed. All methods perform above chance levels at identifying correct connectivity parameters. The sLDSf method was superior in parameter estimation accuracy to both DCM and MAR for all types of comparisons.},

   abstract = {Jones and Dzhafarov (2014) claim that several current models of speeded decision making in cognitive tasks, including the diffusion model, can be viewed as special cases of other general models or model classes. The general models can be made to match any set of response time (RT) distribution and accuracy data exactly by a suitable choice of parameters and so are unfalsifiable. The implication of their claim is that models like the diffusion model are empirically testable only by artificially restricting them to exclude unfalsifiable instances of the general model. We show that Jones and Dzhafarov’s argument depends on enlarging the class of “diffusion” models to include models in which there is little or no diffusion. The unfalsifiable models are deterministic or near-deterministic growth models, from which the effects of within-trial variability have been removed or in which they are constrained to be negligible. These models attribute most or all of the variability in RT and accuracy to across-trial variability in the rate of evidence growth, which is permitted to be distributed arbitrarily and to vary freely across experimental conditions. In contrast, in the standard diffusion model, within-trial variability in evidence is the primary determinant of variability in RT. Across-trial variability, which determines the relative speed of correct responses and errors, is theoretically and empirically constrained. Jones and Dzhafarov’s attempt to include the diffusion model in a class of models that also includes deterministic growth models misrepresents and trivializes it and conveys a misleading picture of cognitive decision-making research.},

In recent years, correlations between attention and choice have been documented in a variety of domains. This leads to the question of whether there is a general, stable relationship between attention and choice. Here, we examined choice behavior in tasks with and without risk and social considerations, using food or monetary rewards, within a single experiment. This allowed us to test the consistency of the decisionmaking process across domains. In the aggregate, we identified remarkable consistency in the attentionchoice link. At the individual level, subjects with strong attentional effects in one task were likely to have strong attentional effects in the others. The strength of these effects also correlated with individuals’ degree of tunnel vision. Thus, the attention– choice relationship appears to be a stable individual trait that is linked to more general attentional constraints.},

   abstract = {The inquisitiveness about what happens in the brain has been there since the beginning of humankind. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a prominent tool which helps in the non-invasive examination, localisation as well as lateralisation of brain functions such as language, memory, etc. In recent years, there is an apparent shift in the focus of neuroscience research to studies dealing with a brain at ‘resting state’. Here the spotlight is on the intrinsic activity within the brain, in the absence of any sensory or cognitive stimulus. The analyses of functional brain connectivity in the state of rest have revealed different resting state networks, which depict specific functions and varied spatial topology. However, different statistical methods have been introduced to study resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity, yet producing consistent results. In this article, we introduce the concept of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in detail, then discuss three most widely used methods for analysis, describe a few of the resting state networks featuring the brain regions, associated cognitive functions and clinical applications of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. This review aims to highlight the utility and importance of studying resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity, underlining its complementary nature to the task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

   title = {Attention promotes the neural encoding of prediction errors},
   journal = {PLoS Biology},
   pages = {22},
   abstract = {The encoding of sensory information in the human brain is thought to be optimised by two principal processes: ‘prediction’ uses stored information to guide the interpretation of forthcoming sensory events, and ‘attention’ prioritizes these events according to their behavioural relevance. Despite the ubiquitous contributions of attention and prediction to various aspects of perception and cognition, it remains unknown how they interact to modulate information processing in the brain. A recent extension of predictive coding theory suggests that attention optimises the expected precision of predictions by modulating the synaptic gain of prediction error units. Because prediction errors code for the difference between predictions and sensory signals, this model would suggest that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to a surprising stimulus. Alternative predictive coding models propose that attention increases the activity of prediction (or ‘representation’) neurons and would therefore suggest that attention and prediction synergistically modulate selectivity for ‘feature information’ in the brain. Here, we applied forward encoding models to neural activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) as human observers performed a simple visual task to test for the effect of attention on both mismatch and feature information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. Participants attended or ignored a periodic stream of gratings, the orientations of which could be either predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. We found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. These findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain, as well as support the theory that attention optimises precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.},

Both approaches share an emphasis on the concepts of stability (attractor states), instability (especially bifurcations), soft-assembly and ﬂexibility. But the dynamic ﬁeld approach adds the concept of ‘activation’ to capture the strength with which behaviorally relevant information is speciﬁed. By explicitly linking these dynamic systems approaches, we allow for more direct comparisons between dynamic systems theory and connectionism. We note three current differences between these two approaches to development: (1) the notion of stability is central to how representational states are conceptualized in the dynamic ﬁeld approach; (2) the dynamic ﬁeld approach is more directly concerned with the sensorimotor origins of cognition; and (3) the dynamic approach is less advanced with regard to learning. We conclude that proponents of the two approaches can learn from the respective strengths of each approach. We suspect these differences will largely disappear in the next 20 years.},

   pages = {41-52},
   abstract = {We contrasted coherence estimates obtained with EEG, Laplacian, and MEG measures of synaptic activity using simulations with head models and simultaneous recordings of EEG and MEG. EEG coherence is often used to assess functional connectivity in human cortex. However, moderate to large EEG coherence can also arise simply by the volume conduction of current through the tissues of the head. We estimated this effect using simulated brain sources and a model of head tissues (cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), skull, and scalp) derived from MRI. We found that volume conduction can elevate EEG coherence at all frequencies for moderately separated (<10 cm) electrodes; a smaller levation is observed with widely separated (>20 cm) electrodes. This volume conduction effect was readily observed in experimental EEG at high frequencies (40–50 Hz). Cortical sources generating spontaneous EEG in this band are apparently uncorrelated. In contrast, lower frequency EEG coherence appears to result from a mixture of volume conduction effects and genuine source coherence. Surface Laplacian EEG methods minimize the effect of volume conduction on coherence estimates by emphasizing sources at smaller spatial scales than unprocessed potentials (EEG). MEG coherence estimates are inﬂated at all frequencies by the ﬁeld spread across the large distance between sources and sensors. This effect is most apparent at sensors separated by less than 15 cm in tangential directions along a surface passing through the sensors. In comparison to long-range (>20 cm) volume conduction effects in EEG, widely spaced MEG sensors show smaller ﬁeld-spread effects, which is a potentially signiﬁcant advantage. However, MEG coherence estimates reﬂect fewer sources at a smaller scale than EEG coherence and may only partially overlap EEG coherence. EEG, Laplacian, and MEG coherence emphasize different spatial scales and orientations of sources.},

Yet such complexity is not evident in the activity of individual neurons or population averages. How then do downstream areas know what to learn in response to these signals? One possibility is that information about content is contained in the pattern of firing across many dopamine neurons. Consistent with this, here we show that the pattern of firing across a small group of dopamine neurons recorded in rats signals the identity of a mis-predicted sensory event. Further, this same information is reflected in the BOLD response elicited by sensory prediction errors in human midbrain. These data provide evidence that ensembles of dopamine neurons provide highly specific teaching signals, opening new possibilities for how this system might contribute to learning.},

   abstract = {Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) fire in anticipation of and during rewards. Such firing has been suggested to encode reward predictions and to account in some way for the role of this area in adaptive behavior and learning. However, it has also been reported that neural activity in OFC reflects reward prediction errors, which might drive learning directly. Here we tested this question by analyzing the firing of OFC neurons recorded in an odor discrimination task in which rats were trained to sample odor cues and respond left or right on each trial for reward. Neurons were recorded across blocks of trials in which we switched either the number or the flavor of the reward delivered in each well. Previously we have described how neurons in this dataset fired to the predictive cues (Stalnaker et al., 2014); here we focused on the firing in anticipation of and just after delivery of each drop of reward, looking specifically for differences in firing based on whether the reward number or flavor was unexpected or expected. Unlike dopamine neurons recorded in this setting, which exhibited phasic error-like responses after surprising changes in either reward number or reward flavor (Takahashi et al., 2017), OFC neurons showed no such error correlates and instead fired in a way that reflected reward predictions.},

   abstract = {Situations in which rewards are unexpectedly obtained or withheld represent opportunities for new learning. Often, this learning includes identifying cues that predict reward availability. Unexpected rewards strongly activate midbrain dopamine neurons. This phasic signal is proposed to support learning about antecedent cues by signaling discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes, termed a reward prediction error. However, it is unknown whether dopamine neuron prediction error signaling and cue-reward learning are causally linked. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated dopamine neuron activity in rats in two behavioral procedures, associative blocking and extinction, that illustrate the essential function of prediction errors in learning. We observed that optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons concurrent with reward delivery, mimicking a prediction error, was sufficient to cause long-lasting increases in cue-elicited reward-seeking behavior. Our findings establish a causal role for temporally precise dopamine neuron signaling in cue-reward learning, bridging a critical gap between experimental evidence and influential theoretical frameworks.},

   abstract = {An ever-increasing number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are now using information-based multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques to decode mental states. In doing so, they achieve a significantly greater sensitivity compared to when they use univariate frameworks. However, the new brain-decoding methods have also posed new challenges for analysis and statistical inference on the group level. We discuss why the usual procedure of performing t-tests on accuracy maps across subjects in order to produce a group statistic is inappropriate. We propose a solution to this problem for local MVPA approaches, which achieves higher sensitivity than other procedures. Our method uses random permutation tests on the single-subject level, and then combines the results on the group level with a bootstrap method. To preserve the spatial dependency induced by local MVPA methods, we generate a random permutation set and keep it fixed across all locations. This enables us to later apply a cluster size control for the multiple testing problem. More specifically, we explicitly compute the distribution of cluster sizes and use this to determine the p-values for each cluster. Using a volumetric searchlight decoding procedure, we demonstrate the validity and sensitivity of our approach using both simulated and real fMRI data sets. In comparison to the standard t-test procedure implemented in SPM8, our results showed a higher sensitivity. We discuss the theoretical applicability and the practical advantages of our approach, and outline its generalization to other local MVPA methods, such as surface decoding techniques.},

Additionally, some approaches, for example Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and variants of Structural Equation Modelling, describe how effective connectivity is modulated by experimental manipulations. Mathematically, both are based on bilinear equations, where the bilinear term models the effect of experimental manipulations on neuronal interactions. The bilinear framework, however, precludes an important aspect of neuronal interactions that has been established with invasive electrophysiological recording studies; i.e., how the connection between two neuronal units is enabled or gated by activity in other units. These gating processes are critical for controlling the gain of neuronal populations and are mediated through interactions between synaptic inputs (e.g. by means of voltage-sensitive ion channels). They represent a key mechanism for various neurobiological processes, including top-down (e.g. attentional) modulation, learning and neuromodulation.},

Given the relative complexity of DCM, compared to conventional analysis techniques, a good knowledge of its theoretical foundations is needed to avoid pitfalls in its application and interpretation of results.

When an inference rule is selected, it commands the thalamus to modify and transmit information between areas of the cortex.

Here we study people’s ability to infer causal structure from both observation and intervention, and to choose informative interventions on the basis of observational data. In three causal inference tasks, participants were to some degree capable of distinguishing between competing causal hypotheses on the basis of purely observational data. Performance improved substantially when participants were allowed to observe the effects of interventions that they performed on the systems. We develop computational models of how people infer causal structure from data and how they plan intervention experiments, based on the representational framework of causal graphical models and the inferential principles of optimal Bayesian decision-making and maximizing expected information gain. These analyses suggest that people can make rational causal inferences, subject to psychologically reasonable representational assumptions and computationally reasonable processing constraints.},

Several commonly accepted signs of integration were also predicted by non-integration strategies. Furthermore, an integration model could fit data generated by nonintegration models. We identified the features of non-integration models that allowed them to mimic integration and used these insights to design a motion discrimination task that disentangled the models. In human subjects performing the task, we falsified a non-integration strategy in each and confirmed prolonged integration in all but one subject.

However, recent work has demonstrated that unexpected changes in value-neutral outcome features, such as identity, can evoke similar responses. It remains unclear whether the magnitude of these identity PEs scales with the perceptual dissimilarity of expected and received rewards, or whether they are independent of perceptual similarity. We used a Pavlovian transreinforcer reversal task to elicit identity PEs for value-matched food odor rewards, drawn from two perceptual categories (sweet, savory). Replicating previous findings, identity PEs were correlated with fMRI activity in midbrain, OFC, piriform cortex, and amygdala. However, the magnitude of identity PE responses was independent of the perceptual distance between expected and received outcomes, suggesting that identity comparisons underlying sensory PEs may occur in an abstract state space independent of straightforward sensory percepts.},

   abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons have been proposed to signal prediction errors as defined in model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. While these algorithms have been extremely powerful in interpreting dopamine activity, these models do not register any error unless there is a difference between the value of what is predicted and what is received. Yet learning often occurs in response to changes in the unique features that characterize what is received, sometimes with no change in its value at all. Here, we show that classic error-signaling dopamine neurons also respond to changes in value-neutral sensory features of an expected reward. This suggests that dopamine neurons have access to a wider variety of information than contemplated by the models currently used to interpret their activity and that, while their firing may conform to predictions of these models in some cases, they are not restricted to signaling errors in the prediction of value.},

   abstract = {Humans and other animals change their behavior in response to unexpected outcomes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is implicated in such adaptive responding, based on evidence from reversal tasks. Yet these tasks confound using information about expected outcomes with learning when those expectations are violated. OFC is critical for the former function; here we show it is also critical for the latter. In a Pavlovian overexpectation task, inactivation of OFC prevented learning driven by unexpected outcomes, even when performance was assessed later. We propose this reﬂects a critical contribution of outcome signaling by OFC to encoding of reward prediction errors elsewhere. In accord with this proposal, we report that signaling of reward predictions by OFC neurons was related to signaling of prediction errors by dopamine neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA). Furthermore, bilateral inactivation of VTA or contralateral inactivation of VTA and OFC disrupted learning driven by unexpected outcomes.},

   abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex has been hypothesized to carry information regarding the value of expected rewards. Such information is essential for associative learning, which relies on comparisons between expected and obtained reward for generating instructive error signals. These error signals are thought to be conveyed by dopamine neurons. To test whether orbitofrontal cortex contributes to these error signals, we recorded from dopamine neurons in orbitofrontal-lesioned rats performing a reward learning task. Lesions caused marked changes in dopaminergic error signaling. However, the effect of lesions was not consistent with a simple loss of information regarding expected value. Instead, without orbitofrontal input, dopaminergic error signals failed to reflect internal information about the impending response that distinguished externally similar states leading to differently valued future rewards. These results are consistent with current conceptualizations of orbitofrontal cortex as supporting model-based behavior and suggest an unexpected role for this information in dopaminergic error signaling.},

   volume = {116},

   pages = {2826-2846},
   abstract = {Objective: Deﬁnition of appropriate frequency bands and choice of recording reference limit the interpretability of quantitative EEG, which may be further compromised by distorted topographies or inverted hemispheric asymmetries when employing conventional (non-linear) power spectra. In contrast, fPCA factors conform to the spectral structure of empirical data, and a surface Laplacian (2-dimensional CSD) simpliﬁes topographies by minimizing volume-conducted activity. Conciseness and interpretability of EEG and CSD fPCA solutions were compared for three common scaling methods. Methods: Resting EEG and CSD (30 channels, nose reference, eyes open/closed) from 51 healthy and 93 clinically-depressed adults were simpliﬁed as power, log power, and amplitude spectra, and summarized using unrestricted, Varimax-rotated, covariance-based fPCA. Results: Multiple alpha factors were separable from artifact and reproducible across subgroups. Power spectra produced numerous, sharplydeﬁned factors emphasizing low frequencies. Log power spectra produced fewer, broader factors emphasizing high frequencies. Solutions for amplitude spectra showed optimal intermediate tuning, particularly when derived from CSD rather than EEG spectra. These solutions were topographically distinct, detecting multiple posterior alpha generators but excluding the dorsal surface of the frontal lobes. Instead a low alpha/theta factor showed a secondary topography along the frontal midline. Conclusions: CSD amplitude spectrum fPCA solutions provide simpler, reference-independent measures that more directly reﬂect neuronal activity. Signiﬁcance: A new quantitative EEG approach affording spectral components is developed that closely parallels the concept of an ERP component in the temporal domain. q 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Analyses of brain activity patterns can reveal what a person is seeing, perceiving, attending to, or remembering. Moreover, multidimensional models can be used to investigate how the brain encodes complex visual scenes or abstract semantic information. Such feats of “brain reading” or “mind reading,” though impressive, raise important conceptual, methodological, and ethical issues. What does successful decoding reveal about the cognitive functions performed by a brain region? How should brain signals be spatially selected and mathematically combined to ensure that decoding reﬂects inherent computations of the brain rather than those performed by the decoder? We highlight recent advances and describe how multivoxel pattern analysis can provide a window into mind-brain relationships with unprecedented speciﬁcity, when carefully applied. However, as brain-reading technology advances, issues of neuroethics and mental privacy will be important to consider.},

   abstract = {Scientists who study cognition infer underlying processes either by observing behavior (e.g., response times, percentage correct) or by observing neural activity (e.g., the BOLD response). These two types of observations have traditionally supported two separate lines of study. The ﬁrst is led by cognitive modelers, who rely on behavior alone to support their computational theories. The second is led by cognitive neuroimagers, who rely on statistical models to link patterns of neural activity to experimental manipulations, often without any attempt to make a direct connection to an explicit computational theory. Here we present a ﬂexible Bayesian framework for combining neural and cognitive models. Joining neuroimaging and computational modeling in a single hierarchical framework allows the neural data to inﬂuence the parameters of the cognitive model and allows behavioral data, even in the absence of neural data, to constrain the neural model. Critically, our Bayesian approach can reveal interactions between behavioral and neural parameters, and hence between neural activity and cognitive mechanisms. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with applications to simulated fMRI data with a recognition model and to diffusion-weighted imaging data with a response time model of perceptual choice.},

However, characterizing an observer’s state of mind is difficult to do with behavioral data alone, particularly on a single-trial basis. In this article, we extend a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian framework for integrating neurophysiological information into cognitive models. In so doing, we develop a novel extension of the well-studied drift diffusion model (DDM) that uses single-trial brain activity patterns to inform the behavioral model parameters. We first show through simulation how the model outperforms the traditional DDM in a prediction task with sparse data. We then fit the model to experimental data consisting of a speed-accuracy manipulation on a random dot motion task. We use our cognitive modeling approach to show how prestimulus brain activity can be used to simultaneously predict response accuracy and response time. We use our model to provide an explanation for how activity in a brain region affects the dynamics of the underlying decision process through mechanisms assumed by the model. Finally, we show that our model performs better than the traditional DDM through a cross-validation test. By combining accuracy, response time, and the blood oxygen level– dependent response into a unified model, the link between cognitive abstraction and neuroimaging can be better understood.},

   abstract = {Signal detection theory forms the core of many current models of cognition, including memory, choice, and categorization. However, the classic signal detection model presumes the a priori existence of fixed stimulus representations— usually Gaussian distributions— even when the observer has no experience with the task. Furthermore, the classic signal detection model requires the observer to place a response criterion along the axis of stimulus strength, and without theoretical elaboration, this criterion is fixed and independent of the observer’s experience. We present a dynamic, adaptive model that addresses these 2 long-standing issues. Our model describes how the stimulus representation can develop from a rough subjective prior and thereby explains changes in signal detection performance over time. The model structure also provides a basis for the signal detection decision that does not require the placement of a criterion along the axis of stimulus strength. We present simulations of the model to examine its behavior and several experiments that provide data to test the model. We also fit the model to recognition memory data and discuss the role that feedback plays in establishing stimulus representations.},

   abstract = {A growing number of researchers have advocated for the advancement of cognitive neuroscience by blending cognitive models with neurophysiology. The recently proposed joint modeling framework is one way to bridge the gap between the abstractions assumed by cognitive models and the neurophysiology obtained by modern methods in neuroscience. Despite this advancement, the current method for linking the two domains is hindered by the dimensionality of the neural data. In this article, we present a new linking function based on factor analysis that allows joint models to grow linearly in complexity with increases in the number of neural features. The new linking function is then evaluated in two simulation studies. The ﬁrst simulation study shows how the model parameters can be accurately recovered when there are many neural features, that mimics realworld applications. The second simulation shows how the new linking function can (1) properly recover a representation of the data generating model, even in the case of model misspeciﬁcation, and (2) outperform the previous linking function in a cross-validation test. We close by applying a model equipped with the new linking function to real-world data from a perceptual decision making task. The model allows us to understand how diﬀerences in the model parameters emerge as a function of diﬀerences in brain function across speed and accuracy instruction.},

In this view, procedural memory is used to learn stimulus-response associations, and declarative memory is used to apply explicit rules and test hypotheses about category membership. However, much less is known about the interaction between these systems: how is control passed between systems as they interact to inﬂuence motor resources? Here, we used fMRI to elucidate the neural correlates of switching between procedural and declarative categorization systems. We identiﬁed a key region of the cerebellum (left Crus I) whose activity was bidirectionally modulated depending on switch direction. We also identiﬁed regions of the default mode network (DMN) that were selectively connected to left Crus I during switching. We propose that the cerebellum—in coordination with the DMN—serves a critical role in passing control between procedural and declarative memory systems.},

Brain mechanisms enabling flexibility have been examined using non-invasive neuroimaging and behavioural approaches in humans alongside pharmacological and lesion studies in animals. This work has identified large-scale functional brain networks encompassing lateral and orbital frontoparietal, midcingulo-insular and frontostriatal regions that support flexibility across the lifespan. Flexibility can be compromised in early-life neurodevelopmental disorders, clinical conditions that emerge during adolescence and late-life dementias. We critically evaluate evidence for the enhancement of flexibility through cognitive training, physical activity and bilingual experience.},

Even simple binary choices are modified by accept/ reject framing and by the presence of decoy options, and they can exhibit circular (i.e., intransitive) patterns of preferences. Each of these phenomena is incompatible with many standard models of choice but may provide crucial clues concerning the elementary mental processes underpinning our choices. One promising theoretical account proposes that choice-related information is selectively gathered through an attentionally limited window favoring goalconsistent information. We review research showing attentional-mediated choice biases and present a computationally explicit model—selective integration—that accounts for these biases.},

   journal = {NeuroImage},
   volume = {189},
   pages = {476-484},
   abstract = {Functional and effective connectivity are known to change systematically over time. These changes might be explained by several factors, including intrinsic ﬂuctuations in activity-dependent neuronal coupling and contextual factors, like experimental condition and time. Furthermore, contextual effects may be subject-speciﬁc or conserved over subjects. To characterize ﬂuctuations in effective connectivity, we used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of cross spectral responses over 1- min of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during rest, divided into 1-sec windows. We focused on two intrinsic networks: the default mode and the saliency network. DCM was applied to estimate connectivity in each time-window for both networks. Fluctuations in DCM connectivity parameters were assessed using hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes (PEB). Within-subject, betweenwindow effects were modelled with a second-level linear model with temporal basis functions as regressors. This procedure was conducted for every subject separately. Bayesian model reduction was then used to assess which (combination of) temporal basis functions best explain dynamic connectivity over windows. A third (betweensubject) level model was used to infer which dynamic connectivity parameters are conserved over subjects. Our results indicate that connectivity ﬂuctuations in the default mode network and to a lesser extent the saliency network comprised both subject-speciﬁc components and a common component. For both networks, connections to higher order regions appear to monotonically increase during the 1- min period. These results not only establish the predictive validity of dynamic connectivity estimates – in virtue of detecting systematic changes over subjects – they also suggest a network-speciﬁc dissociation in the relative contribution of ﬂuctuations in connectivity that depend upon experimental context. We envisage these procedures could be useful for characterizing brain state transitions that may be explained by their cognitive or neuropathological underpinnings.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT Previous work has shown that humans distribute their visual working memory (VWM) resources flexibly across items: the higher the importance of an item, the better it is remembered. A related, but much less studied question is whether people also have control over the total amount of VWM resource allocated to a task. Here, we approach this question by testing whether increasing monetary incentives results in better overall VWM performance. In two experiments, subjects performed a delayed-estimation task on the Amazon Turk platform. In both experiments, four groups of subjects received a bonus payment based on their performance, with the maximum bonus ranging from $0 to $10 between groups. We found no effect of the amount of bonus on intrinsic motivation or on VWM performance in either experiment. These results suggest that resource allocation in visual working memory is insensitive to monetary reward, which has implications for resource-rational theories of VWM.},

   abstract = {Our brain is a network. It consists of spatially distributed, but functionally linked regions that continuously share information with each other. Interestingly, recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.},

   volume = {139},
   pages = {294-303},
   abstract = {Deciding between multiple courses of action often entails an increasing need to do something as time passes - a sense of urgency. This notion of urgency is not incorporated in standard theories of speeded decision making that assume information is accumulated until a critical ﬁxed threshold is reached. Yet, it is hypothesized in novel theoretical models of decision making. In two experiments, we investigated the behavioral and neural evidence for an “urgency signal” in human perceptual decision making. Experiment 1 found that as the duration of the decision making process increased, participants made a choice based on less evidence for the selected option. Experiment 2 replicated this ﬁnding, and additionally found that variability in this effect across participants covaried with activation in the striatum. We conclude that individual differences in susceptibility to urgency are reﬂected by striatal activation. By dynamically updating a response threshold, the striatum is involved in signaling urgency in humans.},

For instance, Bayesian hypothesis testing allows researchers to quantify evidence and monitor its progression as data come in, without needing to know the intention with which the data were collected. We end by countering several objections to Bayesian hypothesis testing. Part II of this series discusses JASP, a free and open source software program that makes it easy to conduct Bayesian estimation and testing for a range of popular statistical scenarios (Wagenmakers et al., this issue).},

   pages = {1-22},
   abstract = {Schizophrenia is associated with a number of deﬁcits in decision-making, but the scope, nature, and cause of these deﬁcits are not completely understood. Here we focus on a particular type of decision, known as the explore/exploit dilemma, in which people must choose between exploiting options that yield relatively known rewards and exploring more ambiguous options of uncertain reward probability or magnitude. Previous work has shown that healthy people use two distinct strategies to decide when to explore: directed exploration, which involves choosing options that would reduce uncertainty about the reward values (information seeking), and random exploration (exploring by chance), which describes behavioral variability that is not goal directed. We administered a recently developed gambling task designed to quantify both directed and random exploration to 108 patients with schizophrenia (PSZ) and 33 healthy volunteers (HVs). We found that PSZ patients show reduced directed exploration relative to HVs, but no difference in random exploration. Moreover, patients’ directed exploration behavior clusters into two qualitatively different behavioral phenotypes. In the ﬁrst phenotype, which accounts for the majority of the patients (79%) and is consistent with previously reported behavior, directed exploration is only marginally (but signiﬁcantly) reduced, suggesting that these patients can use directed exploration, but at a slightly lower level than community controls. In contrast, the second phenotype, comprising 21% of patients, exhibit a form of “extreme ambiguity aversion,” in which they almost never choose more informative options, even when they are clearly of higher value. Moreover, in PSZ, deﬁcits in directed exploration were related to measures of intellectual function, whereas random exploration was related to positive symptoms. Taken together, our results suggest that schizophrenia has differential effects on directed and random exploration and that investigating the explore/exploit dilemma in psychosis patients may reveal subgroups of patients with qualitatively different patterns of exploration.},

   abstract = {Polymorphous concepts are hard to learn, and this is perhaps surprising because they, like many natural concepts, have an overall similarity structure. However, the dimensional summation hypothesis (Milton & Wills, 2004) predicts this difficulty. It also makes a number of other predictions about polymorphous concept formation, which are tested here. In Experiment 1 we confirm the theory's prediction that polymorphous concept formation should be facilitated by deterministic pretraining on the constituent features of the stimulus. This facilitation is relative to an equivalent amount of training on the polymorphous concept itself. In Experiments 2--4, the dimensional summation account of this single feature pretraining effect is contrasted with some other accounts, including a more general strategic account (Experiment 2), seriality of training and stimulus decomposition accounts (Experiment 3), and the role of errors (Experiment 4). The dimensional summation hypothesis provides the best account of these data. In Experiment 5, a further prediction is confirmed --- the single feature pretraining effect is eliminated by a concurrent counting task. The current experiments suggest the hypothesis that natural concepts might be acquired by the deliberate serial summation of evidence. This idea has testable implications for classroom learning.},

   abstract = {Every day people make new choices between alternatives that they have never directly experienced. Yet, such decisions are often made rapidly and confidently. Here, we show that the hippocampus, traditionally known for its role in building long-term declarative memories, enables the spread of value across memories, thereby guiding decisions between new choice options. Using functional brain imaging in humans, we discovered that giving people monetary rewards led to activation of a preestablished network of memories, spreading the positive value of reward to nonrewarded items stored in memory. Later, people were biased to choose these nonrewarded items. This decision bias was predicted by activity in the hippocampus, reactivation of associated memories, and connectivity between memory and reward regions in the brain. These findings explain how choices among new alternatives emerge automatically from the associative mechanisms by which the brain builds memories. Further, our findings demonstrate a previously unknown role for the hippocampus in value-based decisions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past decade research has shown that continuous (cTBS) and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) alter neuronal excitability levels in the primary motor cortex. OBJECTIVE: Quantitatively review the magnitude and time course on cortical excitability of cTBS and iTBS. METHODS: Sixty-four TBS studies published between January 2005 and October 2014 were retrieved from the scientific search engine PubMED and included for analyses. The main inclusion criteria involved stimulation of the primary motor cortex in healthy volunteers with no motor practice prior to intervention and motor evoked potentials as primary outcome measure. RESULTS: ITBS applied for 190 s significantly increases cortical excitability up to 60 min with a mean maximum potentiation of 35.54 +/- 3.32%. CTBS applied for 40 s decreases cortical excitability up to 50 min with a mean maximum depression of -22.81 +/- 2.86%, while cTBS applied for 20 s decreases cortical excitability (mean maximum -27.84 +/- 4.15%) for 20 min. CONCLUSION: The present findings offer normative insights into the magnitude and time course of TBS-induced changes in cortical excitability levels.},

Whether and how such abstracted representations may be used to assign credit for inferred, but unobserved, relationships in structured environments are unknown. We develop a hierarchical reversal-learning task and Bayesian learning model to assess the computational and neural mechanisms underlying how humans infer specific choice-outcome associations via structured knowledge. We find that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) efficiently represents hierarchically related choice-outcome associations governed by the same latent cause, using a generalized code to assign credit for both experienced and inferred outcomes. Furthermore, the mPFC and lateral orbitofrontal cortex track the current "position" within a latent association space that generalizes over stimuli. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of both tracking the current position in an abstracted task space and efficient, generalizable representations in the prefrontal cortex for supporting flexible learning and inference in structured environments.},

   abstract = {Gradient-echo MRI of resonance-frequency shift and T2* values exhibit unique tissue contrast and offer relevant physiological information. However, acquiring 3D-phase images and T2* maps with the standard spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequence is lengthy for routine imaging at high-spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage. In addition, with the standard SPGR sequence, optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cannot be achieved for every tissue type given their distributed resonance frequency and T2* value. To address these two issues, a SNR optimized multi-echo sequence with a stack-of-spiral acquisition is proposed and implemented for achieving fast and simultaneous acquisition of image phase and T2* maps. The analytical behavior of the phase SNR is derived as a function of resonance frequency, T2* and echo time. This relationship is utilized to achieve tissue optimized SNR by combining phase images with different echo times. Simulations and in vivo experiments were designed to verify the theoretical predictions. Using the multi-echo spiral acquisition, whole-brain coverage with 1 mm isotropic resolution can be achieved within 2.5 min, shortening the scan time by a factor of 8. The resulting multi-echo phase map shows similar SNR to that of the standard SPGR. The acquisition can be further accelerated with non-Cartesian parallel imaging. The technique can be readily extended to other multi-shot readout trajectories besides spiral. It may provide a practical acquisition strategy for high resolution and simultaneous 3D mapping of magnetic susceptibility and T2*.},

Bottom-up dynamics (stimulus-locked gamma power and spiking) in the ventral PFC processed more low-level abstractions, whereas top-down dynamics (beta power and beta spike-LFP coherence) in the dorsal PFC processed more high-level abstractions.

   abstract = {The human brain is a complex system whose topological organization can be represented using connectomics. Recent studies have shown that human connectomes can be constructed using various neuroimaging technologies and further characterized using sophisticated analytic strategies, such as graph theory. These methods reveal the intriguing topological architectures of human brain networks in healthy populations and explore the changes throughout normal development and aging and under various pathological conditions. However, given the huge complexity of this methodology, toolboxes for graph-based network visualization are still lacking. Here, using MATLAB with a graphical user interface (GUI), we developed a graph-theoretical network visualization toolbox, called BrainNet Viewer, to illustrate human connectomes as ball-and-stick models. Within this toolbox, several combinations of defined files with connectome information can be loaded to display different combinations of brain surface, nodes and edges. In addition, display properties, such as the color and size of network elements or the layout of the figure, can be adjusted within a comprehensive but easy-to-use settings panel. Moreover, BrainNet Viewer draws the brain surface, nodes and edges in sequence and displays brain networks in multiple views, as required by the user. The figure can be manipulated with certain interaction functions to display more detailed information. Furthermore, the figures can be exported as commonly used image file formats or demonstration video for further use. BrainNet Viewer helps researchers to visualize brain networks in an easy, flexible and quick manner, and this software is freely available on the NITRC website (www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/).},

   abstract = {Objective: The study aims to investigate the after-effect of three sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on motor cortical excitability. The iTBS was induced over the primary motor cortex (M1) at different time intervals. Methods: The study has a crossover design. Sixteen participants were assigned to three groups and received different accelerated iTBS (aiTBS) protocols during each visit: (1) three continuous sessions with no interval (iTBS18000); (2) three iTBS sessions with 10-min intervals (iTBS600 × 3∗10); and (3) three iTBS sessions with 30-min intervals (iTBS600 × 3∗30). As washout period, each visit is separated by at least 7 days. We measured the motor cortical excitability changes and intracortical inhibition. Results: A dose of 1,800 pulses of aiTBS per day is tolerable. The iTBS1800 led to a reduced cortical excitability; whereas iTBS600 × 3∗10 and iTBS600 × 3∗30 enhanced cortical excitability to a differential extent. After a total dose of 1,800 pulses, iTBS600 × 3∗30 exhibited the longer effect and highest percentage of individuals with enhanced cortical excitability. Conclusion: The results suggest that aiTBS protocols at different time intervals result in different motor cortical excitability after-effects.},

   abstract = {Fluid reasoning is considered central to general intelligence. How its psychometric structure relates to brain function remains poorly understood. For instance, what is the dynamic composition of ability-speciﬁc processes underlying ﬂuid reasoning? We investigated whether distinct ﬂuid reasoning abilities could be differentiated by electroencephalography (EEG) microstate proﬁles. EEG microstates speciﬁcally capture rapidly altering activity of distributed cortical networks with a high temporal resolution as scalp potential topographies that dynamically vary over time in an organized manner. EEG was recorded simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in twenty healthy adult participants during cognitively distinct ﬂuid reasoning tasks: induction, spatial relationships and visualization. Microstate parameters successfully discriminated between ﬂuid reasoning and visuomotor control tasks as well as between the ﬂuid reasoning tasks. Mainly, microstate B coverage was signiﬁcantly higher during spatial relationships and visualization, compared to induction, while microstate C coverage was signiﬁcantly decreased during spatial relationships and visualization, compared to induction. Additionally, microstate D coverage was highest during spatial relationships and microstate A coverage was most strongly reduced during the same condition. Consistently, multivariate analysis with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure accurately classiﬁed the ﬂuid reasoning tasks based on the coverage parameter. These EEG data and their correlation with fMRI data suggest that especially the tasks most strongly relying on visuospatial processing modulated visual and default mode network activity. We propose that EEG microstates can provide valuable information about neural activity patterns with a dynamic and complex temporal structure during ﬂuid reasoning, suggesting cognitive ability-speciﬁc interplays between multiple brain networks.},

   abstract = {Memory enables flexible use of past experience to inform new behaviors. Although leading theories hypothesize that this fundamental flexibility results from the formation of integrated memory networks relating multiple experiences, the neural mechanisms that support memory integration are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that retrieval-mediated learning, whereby prior event details are reinstated during encoding of related experiences, supports participants' ability to infer relationships between distinct events that share content. Furthermore, we show that activation changes in a functionally coupled hippocampal and ventral medial prefrontal cortical circuit track the formation of integrated memories and successful inferential memory performance. These findings characterize the respective roles of these regions in retrieval-mediated learning processes that support relational memory network formation and inferential memory in the human brain. More broadly, these data reveal fundamental mechanisms through which memory representations are constructed into prospectively useful formats.},

   journal = {arXiv:1611.03530 [cs]},
   abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

   volume = {325},
   pages = {108318},
   abstract = {Background: Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals, visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft visual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or datadriven features (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also assume a linear mapping between feature representations to brain activity. However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for maximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding framework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear mapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve prediction accuracy on measured activity in the human visual cortex. Results: The proposed framework can significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e., V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy. Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding models, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher prediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings from visual features to brain activity.},
