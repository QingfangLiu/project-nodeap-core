- **Action Taken**:
  - Entire **Session 2** treated as **missing data**.

### 🗓️ Session Schedule & Conditions

| Session | Date       | Stimulation | Devaluation       |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| S1D1    | 2.13.23    | cTBS        | —                 |
| S1D2    | 2.14.23    | Sham        | Sweet             |
| S2D1    | 2.28.23    | Sham        | —                 |
| S2D2    | 3.1.23     | cTBS        | Sweet             |
| S3D1    | 3.13.23    | Sham        | —                 |
| S3D2    | 3.14.23    | Sham        | Savory            |

- **Note**:
  - Follows a **1–2–3 stimulation order**, which is consistent with counterbalancing.
  - However, the **devaluation order is unusual**:
    - Sweet was devalued twice (Sessions 1 and 2),
    - Savory only in Session 3.
- **Action Needed**:
  - Must **account for this irregular devaluation pattern** in the analysis.

## 🧪 Conditioning Data: General Notes

- One subject **missed one conditioning run**, but the data was **recovered from intermediate variables**.
- For **all other subjects and runs**, conditioning data in the **final dataset match** the intermediate data after checking.
