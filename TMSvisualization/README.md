## 🎯 MRI Stimulation Coordinates: Versions & Discrepancies

### 📁 Coordinate Versions

- **`StimCoord.xlsx`**
  - Coordinates generated by **rerunning the coordinate processing code**
  - Based on the **old method** of combining echoes

- **`StimCoord_server_data.xlsx`**
  - Coordinates **organized from previous processed .mat files**
  - Missing 3 subjects:
    - `NODEAP_35`: Not found, but has **identical coordinates** → ✅ Acceptable
    - `NODEAP_43`: Not found, and has **different coordinates** → ⚠️ Needs follow-up
    - `NODEAP_70`: Not found, but has **identical coordinates** → ✅ Acceptable

- **`StimCoord_Daria.xlsx`**
  - Coordinates that **Daria actually used** for stimulation, based on **experiment notes**

### 🚨 Abnormal Stimulation Coordinates

- **`NODEAP_73`**
  - Subject was assigned to **anterior stimulation**
  - However, **posterior stimulation coordinates were used** in the experiment

- **`NODEAP_55`**
  - Coordinates recorded in **experiment notes** do **not match** those calculated by Daria
  - Manual check confirmed they fall **within the expected LPFC region**
  - Decided to **retain the coordinates from experiment notes**
